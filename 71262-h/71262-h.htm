<h4>CHAPTER IV—<i>Concluded</i>.</h4>

<p>Sullivan having heard nothing from either Brodhead or Clinton,
became especially anxious about the latter, fearing that he might be
waylaid by a union of the Tories under Butler and McDonald with
Brant’s forces. On the 16th of August, he sent forward a picked force
of nine hundred men, under Generals Poor and Hand, with the Coehorn
mortar and eight days’ rations, to advance and meet the right wing.
Marching to Owego, then an Indian village, and to Choconut, containing
fifty long houses, they heard at sunset of the 18th, Clinton’s evening gun.
This they answered with their Coehorn. Between the present city of
Binghamton and Owego the two forces met and the forest resounded with
sounds of mutual acclaim and welcome to brothers in arms. The place
of their junction, as we see on the map, is named Union, now a flourishing
village. Then the host, the flotilla in boats and the men along the flats
and heights, moved down the Susquehanna in fine array. As the united
forces of men from three states thus drew near the camp at Tioga Point,
Sullivan ordered out the whole army to give them welcome. The fifers
and drummers furnished lively music and a <i>feu de joie</i>, by the infantry
drawn up in single line, completed the ceremonies. This was at noon on
Sunday, 21st, and on the site of the present village of Athens.</p>

<p>Previous to the arrival of Clinton’s brigade, Sullivan (August 11)
had sent westward up the river valley, a party of eight of his bravest
officers and men, to reconnoiter the Indian town of Chemung. This collection
of bark houses was built on the first great river flat above the
village in Chemung county, at present called by that name. Keeping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</span>
away from the trail they reached the hill top and looked down upon the
town, finding everything in confusion. The Indians fearing an immediate
attack in force, were getting ready to move westward. When this scouting
party returned to the main camp at three o’clock the next day, Sullivan
ordered his whole force to be ready to march at a moment’s notice.
At 8 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span>, August 12, he started with most of his force on a night march
and pushed on through swamps and forests. At morning finding themselves
in a fog, they also discovered that the enemy had fled.</p>

<p>General Hand asked that he be allowed to take Colonel Hubley’s
regiment and the Wyoming companies to pursue the foe. This request
was granted and our men pushed eagerly on. In spite of all wariness,
Captain Bush’s company of the Eleventh Pennsylvania got into an Indian
ambush, and six of the Continentals were killed and nine wounded. Our
men rallied and drove the Indians off the ground with a loss equal to their
own. Then they began destroying sixty acres of standing corn, then in
the milk, by cutting down the stalks. While at this work they were again
fired on by the Indians in hiding, and one man was killed and five were
wounded. Forty acres of maize were left untouched for the future use
of the army, and then the whole force returned, greatly wearied with
fatigue and the extreme heat. The bodies of the dead were brought back
to camp for decent burial.</p>

<p>It was a sad occasion, when in the forest, the seven slain were buried
in one grave, which, as was usual, had all outward marks obliterated, so
that the savages could not exhume and mutilate the corpses. Then their
comrades fired memorial vollies. Thus perished by the bullets of the
enemy the first of the men in Sullivan’s main expedition. Two days afterwards,
a corporal and four men, who were guarding cattle on Queen
Esther’s plains, were fired on by sneaking Indians. One was shot dead
and one wounded. In the rude hospital, quickly built out of green wood,
within the lines of the diamond-shaped Fort Sullivan, the fifteen wounded
men found shelter and care. In 1897, in digging foundations for the
edifice of the Tioga Point Historical Society, at Athens, Pa., the bones of
the buried Continentals were exhumed, and with other relics of 1779 are
now under glass in the cases of the Spalding Museum.</p>

<p>Having his whole effective force under his direct command, Sullivan
reorganized the army, and announced both the order of march and the
order of battle. The light troops under General Hand were to form
the advance, the riflemen acting as scouts. Poor’s brigade was to guard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</span>
the right and Maxwell’s brigade the left of the army, Clinton’s brigade
forming the rear guard. The park of nine pieces of artillery was placed
in the center, with three columns of pack horses on either side. A
morning and evening gun was to be fired daily and on account of the
length and narrowness of the moving line through the woods, a horn, instead
of drums, was to announce the orders to march or halt. The corps
of engineers and surveyors were to measure each rod of ground traversed,
and maps of the region traversed were to be made.</p>

<p>In the fort, Colonel Shreve was left with a garrison of two hundred
and fifty men of the New Jersey regiment. It was ordered that when
further supplies should come up from Wyoming, Captain Reed should
proceed up the Chemung Valley, build a fort where Newtown Creek joins
the river (at Elmira), and there await the return of the army from the
Genesee valley.</p>

<p>The army was now eager to move into the unknown wilderness.
The route was up the Chemung river, into the Seneca country, and through
the Land of Lakes. There was no hope of reinforcements or relief, and,
in case of defeat, of any quarter from the foe. Over paths never trodden
by any white man, save the lone trader, trapper, or captive, they must now
find much of their food and rely wholly on their own valor. How brave
must these men have been, and how equally worthy of fame and honor,
was this expedition in comparison with Sherman’s march through Georgia
to the sea in 1864.</p>

<p>(It is to be noted that in the Centennial celebration of 1879, General
William Tecumseh Sherman, was present in the Chemung valley, with
words of memorial and congratulations to the thousands present, as well
as with praise of the men of 1779 who had given him so inspiring a precedent
of success.)</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<h4>CHAPTER V<br> THE GREAT BATTLE NEAR ELMIRA</h4>

</div>
<p>One of the first obstacles to the army, was a very high hill at the edge of
the river. To avoid this, all but the infantry crossed the river twice,
being supported and guarded against hostile attack by Maxwell’s New
Jersey regiments. The other brigades marched over the hill, and camp<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</span>
was made on the site of the Indian town of Chemung which the advanced
detachments had destroyed two weeks before.</p>

<p>Our fathers thought few articles of food more delicious than green
corn roasted in the ear. So the maize in the fields near by helped to make
a good supper. In addition, the army enjoyed a feast of potatoes, beans,
cucumbers, watermelons, squashes and other vegetables which were here
in great plenty. It was the season of ripeness.</p>

<p>Towards the end of July, there had gathered together, whites and
reds, Indians, Tories, Royal Greens and British regulars, numbering over
a thousand men, at Newtown, the Indian town near Baldwin’s Creek, opposite
to the present village of Wellsburg on the Erie, and at Lohmansville
on the Lackawanna railroad. Here they were for weeks hard at
work. Tearing down the Indian houses, they built, with the old and
fresh-cut logs, a fortification that extended up the slope of the hill to the
north and along the western ridge nearer the Chemung river.</p>

<p>But where was the enemy? It was known that the raid of Brant,
down the Walkill valley to the Delaware, had failed to draw Sullivan
from his main purpose. The other parties of Tories and Indians had
been equally impotent. What then should be done to drive back the
avenging army and save their villages and crops?</p>

<p>Evidently the only safety was to join all forces. At a great council
of Tories and Iroquois, held where Geneva now stands, it was decided to
send wampum belts again to every and all tribes and bands of the Iroquois,
and bid them assemble to oppose the invaders in the Chemung valley.
Some of the parties that started in response to this call arrived too late.
The notorious John Butler, who had led the expedition against Wyoming,
was in command of the mixed forces of King George, red, black, and
white, and the strategy and tactics employed by him showed the combination
of the crafts of both savage and civilized man.</p>

<p>On Saturday evening, August 28, Sullivan’s advance pickets heard
the sound of axes and saw many fires brightly burning along the hills
just beyond Baldwin’s Creek. A scout sent out a day or two before, reported
that the enemy were fortified just beyond the creek and west of the
Indian village of Newtown. The march must now be made with a constant
reference to ambuscade and with the greatest wariness. “Above
all, no Braddocking.”</p>

<p>On Sunday, August 29, the day broke with every indication of very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</span>
hot weather. The air was close and heavy. The army moved at nine
o’clock, the riflemen being well scattered in front of Hand’s light corps,
so as to act as scouts and skirmishers, while every man in the brigade
moved with the greatest caution. Hardly had they gone a mile, before
they discovered several Indians in front. One of these fired and then
all fled. Going forward still further a mile, the riflemen found the
ground low, marshy and well fitted for the shelter of hiding Indians.
Moving slowly and alertly, they discovered another party of Indians, who
as before, fired and retreated. Evidently their purpose was to lure the
Americans into ambush.</p>

<p>Major Parr, commander of the rifle corps, now determined to advance
no further without reconnoitering every foot of the ground.
Ordering his men to halt, he sent one of them to climb the highest tree
and survey the whole situation. The scout was unable at first to discover
anything peculiar, but peering intently ahead, he made out a line of
brushwood artfully concealed with green boughs and trees. Starting
from near the Chemung river on the left, it ran up the slope of a high hill
to the right, for possibly half a mile. Here had been the Indian village
of Newtown, consisting of twenty-five or thirty bark houses, but most of
the houses had given way to timber entrenchments and to the camp inside
of them, though two or three were left so as to form, as it were, bastions
for the newly-built fort.</p>

<p>Here the enemy had gathered to make their determined stand.
Their force, numbering about nine hundred warriors from five tribes, had
been reinforced by between two and three hundred white men, Tories and
Canadians, drilled and aided by fifteen regular soldiers of the British
army, and commanded by Butler, McDonald, and Brant, while two or
three hundred more warriors were soon expected.</p>

<p>Such a position was a formidable obstacle to the advance even of an
army provided with artillery. The right flank of the British rested on
the river, their left on the side of a hill, while immediately in front of them
and for a space of about one hundred yards was a clear field which their
fire could sweep easily. Between this field and the Continental lines was a
stream, since called Baldwin’s Creek, and then very difficult to cross. On
the American right lay a valley so low and marshy that an attack in flank
would seem nearly impossible. Thus the place was evidently well chosen.</p>

<p>Nearly the whole story of Indian craft in war is told in the one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</span>
word, concealment. To hide their breastworks with the hope that the
invaders might come very near to them without their being discovered,
the Tories and Indians had laid boughs and greenery over the front and
top. They had even planted out in front, here and there, fresh young
trees, so as to give the appearance of primitive and untouched forests.
They had stuck these young trees in the ground outside the breastworks
and had thoroughly cleaned up the ground, so that no chips or evidence
of human industry were left lying about. They hoped also that Sullivan’s
troops would rush for plunder into the few Indian houses left standing
outside the lines and would thus be entrapped.</p>

<p>Evidently, also it was their design that the Continentals, moving in
a narrow defile and strung out in a line several miles long, should be
caught between the river and the entrenchments, while the Indians in
ambuscade could pour in their fire. They hoped to “Braddock” Sullivan’s
force by stampeding the pack horses and cattle. On the high hill
across the river, and on the summit to the northward, watching parties
were stationed by Brant so that at the right moment they could quickly
descend. Then by frightening the animals, sending them flying in every
direction, they could complete the destruction of the army thus huddled
together. With so many chances in their favor, the Tories and Indians
hoped to give the Continental army such a check as to compel its return.</p>

<p>All these plans were frustrated by the great caution of Sullivan and
the alertness of his lieutenants. When Major Parr, about noon, reported
to his superior the situation of the enemy, Hand sent forward the riflemen
to occupy the banks of the creek, within one hundred yards of the
breastworks and under cover. The light brigade then moved to within
three hundred yards and deployed in line of battle. Sullivan coming forward
with the main army, sent Ogden’s flanking division along the river
to the left of Hand’s light brigade and further to the west. He ordered
Maxwell to remain in the rear in reserve. For a flank attack, he detached
two brigades, Poor’s New Hampshire and Clinton’s New York, to move
to the right and north. They were to make their way up the swampy
valley, and gain, if possible, the enemy’s left and rear. In order to divert
attention from this flank attack, Hand’s light corps opened in the center,
while Proctor’s nine guns were run forward and posted on a hillock, directly
in front of the angle of the breastworks and about two hundred
yards distance from them. As everything had to be done in a rough<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</span>
country in the woods, on a fearfully hot day, it took several hours to get
the batteries and the brigades into position.</p>

<p>Then opened a lively fusilade, of small arms, which held the attention
of the enemy. It was proposed to allow until three o’clock for Poor
and Clinton to reach the top of the hill (now called Sullivan’s Hill, on
which the lofty monument stands), whence they were to turn and charge
down upon the enemy. Yet Sullivan listened long in vain for the sound of
musketry upon the distant right wing, notwithstanding that it was Poor’s
intention to advance with unloaded guns and charge with the bayonet, for
Wayne’s handsome work at Stony Point on July 16, only six weeks before,
had stirred the army with an ambition to achieve a similar victory with cold
steel. Colonel Cilley, who commanded a New Hampshire regiment, had
been with Wayne on the Hudson and was now with Poor.</p>

<p>At three o’clock, Sullivan thinking it not wise to wait longer, gave
order to Proctor to open fire with all his guns. The two howitzers, the
little Coehorn and the six cannon opened with a terrific roar, while the
light corps were ordered to be in readiness for a charge, as soon as the
firing of the flanking column was heard. It was intended that the cannonade
should be the prelude to a general advance on front and flank. The
guns grew hot with firing, however, before anything was heard from the
New Hampshire men, who had been obliged to face unexpected difficulties
and especially to flounder through swamps, far deeper than anyone had
supposed.</p>

<p>Proctor’s round shot, grape and bombs not only cut and tore the
forest trees to the terror of the savages, but did terrible execution. In
many places within the enemy’s line the bloody proofs of the terrific and
destructive power of the shell fire were afterwards amply evident. Brant,
their mighty leader, found it was all he could do to hold his painted warriors
together. Suddenly, rather to their relief, than otherwise, runners
from the hilltop came to inform their chief that the enemy had made an
attack in force on their left flank, driven in the party of watchers, and were
moving forward on the main body. Glad to escape the terrific missiles of
the artillery, and to give his braves congenial occupation and one more suitable
to Indian warfare, Brant led off a large party, possibly the majority
of his warriors, to repel this new danger.</p>

<p>Turning now to the hilltop on the right and to the flanking operations,
we behold the most startling episode of the battle, when for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</span>
moment it looked as if a cloud of red men was about to overwhelm this one
isolated body of their foes. The second New Hampshire regiment under
Colonel Reid, separated from the others in the brigade, suddenly found
themselves partly surrounded by a semi-circle of rifles and hatchets. Their
thin scattered line of riflemen, sent out to scour the woods as skirmishers,
and at this time only a few yards in front of them, was quickly driven back
before a whirlwind of fire. With unloaded muskets, the destruction of
Reid’s regiment seemed certain. Nevertheless the salvation of the Americans
was in the Indians firing too high. They were too certain of victory
to keep cool and take sure aim.</p>

<p>This was the situation—Dearborn’s Third New Hampshire, Alden’s
Sixth Massachusetts, Cilley’s First New Hampshire, and Du Bois’s two
hundred and fifty picked New Yorkers, on the extreme right flank, and far
to the northwest of the main body, made up, with the Second New Hampshire,
the brigade. These regiments moving in the woods, in a country
which no white man had ever penetrated, had become quite separated from
each other. Poor, the commander, hoping to completely outflank the
enemy, was far ahead on the right, too distant to be heard from. Clinton’s
brigade, consisting of the Third New York under Gansevoort, the
Fifth New York commanded by Du Bois, the Fourth New York led by
Livingston, and the Second New York on the right under Van Cortlandt,
formed the reserve, but they were still far below in the rear. The regiments
were all small, numbering each about three hundred men. The
great and imminent danger was that Brant’s seven hundred warriors might
wholly overwhelm the men of one regiment before help could reach them
from their comrades.</p>

<p>Such disaster seemed now to threaten. Starting his men on the run,
Brant had reached the hill top, just as the men of Reid’s Second New
Hampshire, nearly out of breath, and toiling amid the terrific heat, were
only half way up the rough face of the rather steep eastern slope. At
the extreme left of their brigade and nearest the British breastworks,
which were a few hundred rods to the westward, Reid’s men found themselves
far away and out of sight from their comrades in the other regiments,
which were further to the right—east and north. Their guns were
unloaded while their ears were deafened with the yell of hundreds of
exultant savages who felt sure of scalps. In a moment more they were
face to face with the foe. With their empty muskets, defeat and massacre
seemed certain. They realized that their brigadier, Poor, was far away<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</span>
to the right, pressing his troops on to the attack, hoping to close in upon
the enemy and prevent their retreat.</p>

<p>There was but one thing to do. It was to fix bayonets and charge.
Reid shouted the order. His men, jaded as they were, pushed further up
the hill, driving the enemy for a moment before them and getting a bare
chance, in the momentary lull, to load their guns. Then began the usual
fusilade among the trees. Yet it was still a desperate uncertainty and the
enemy outnumbered them.</p>

<p>Not far away, Dearborn, with the Third New Hampshire, hearing
the firing, realized at once the peril in which Reid was. Without waiting
a moment, he took the responsibility, without orders, to right about face.
He did so, supporting Reid and striking the enemy on the flank, while
Clinton, equally alert, pushed forward two of his regiments. His object
was to support the New Hampshires and if possible gain Brant’s rear.</p>

<p>Then ensued a severe fight in the woods, which from the nature of the
situation could not last very long. Brant seeing his plans upset, ordered
his men to retreat and save themselves.</p>

<p>At the same time, further down on the flats, Sullivan having heard
the report of the guns on the hill, at once ordered an advance along the
whole line. With cheers our men rushed over the entrenchments, and
then a running fight of several miles, indeed all the way into the limits of
the modern city of Elmira, ensued. Nevertheless the enemy were able to
escape, being much more familiar with the country. They carried away
their wounded in canoes up the river, and made off with, or concealed some
of the bodies of their dead.</p>

<p>The battlefield was fully occupied by our trains and camp, and about
six o’clock in the afternoon, when the pursuit stopped, three cheers told
the story of another American victory. The known loss of the enemy
was thirteen whites and many Indians. Twenty-six corpses of red men
were found upon the field. Two prisoners, one a negro and one a Tory
with his face painted black, were taken. General Sullivan reported three
killed and twenty-nine wounded, five of whom afterwards died. All the
patriot dead and most of the wounded were New Hampshire men, and
all the casualties except four were in Poor’s brigade, Reid’s regiment
suffering the worst.</p>

<p>In reality this was one of the great decisive battles of the Revolution,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</span>
for it broke forever the power of the Iroquois. Throughout the war,
except in small parties, neither Tories nor savages were able to gather for
raids. As a military factor the warriors of the Six Nations never again
appeared in or with an army. Sullivan and his soldiers had ended the
flank attacks on the army, and opened the way for civilization into western
New York and Pennsylvania. Indeed, for over half a century, or
until the railways dictated the lines of travel, “Sullivan’s Road” was the
main highway into New York from Pennsylvania.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br> IN THE WONDERFUL LAKE REGION</h4>
</div>



<p>It began to rain on Sunday shortly after the battle firing was over, and
the next day, Monday, August 30, was a day of rest.</p>

<p>It was also necessary, in consequence of the very poor and
insufficient provisions, as well as the want of enough pack horses, to cut
down to one-half the rations of flour, salt and meat. However, as the
country through which they were to march was rich in vegetable food,
Sullivan issued orders, stating the facts, and asking that “the troops will
please to consider the matter and give their opinion as soon as possible.”
So late that afternoon the whole army was drawn up in the separate brigades
and regiments. Then the question was put whether they would
advance, taking the risk of hunger.</p>

<p>“Without a dissenting voice, the whole army cheerfully agreed to
the request of the General, which was signified by unanimously holding
up their hands and giving three cheers.” Neither the remembered horrors
of Valley Forge, nor the risk of possible starvation could discourage the
army. With many a laugh and joke, the men moved forward to their
“Succotash Campaign.” They were happy to know that the heavier
artillery, the two howitzers and brace of six pounders were to be sent
back. The labor of drawing ammunition wagons and heavy cannon up
and down hills would be much reduced. Nevertheless, the four three
pounders and caissons, taken along with the Coehorn, meant much chopping
in the woods to make a path.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, the line of march was taken up through the broken,
swampy, and mountainous country. For their night’s camp the men were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</span>
happy to find a level plain, but the next day they had to go through Bear
Swamp, which was then a horrible dark quagmire six miles long. Having
a clay bottom, the black mire held the water which flowed tortuously
through the spongy soil, in which the vegetation of centuries had made a
peaty mass, which the recent rains had made as unstable as a jelly and
slippery as soap. Here was the divide of waters between the Susquehanna
and the Saint Lawrence rivers, flowing into the Atlantic at Labrador
or Hatteras. The Indian trail through this soggy country passed
through defiles, over mounds and through ravine after ravine, rough and
scrubby, while through all meandered a stream of dark water. Only
with the most tremendous toil were the Continentals able to get through,
and the rear guard did not reach hard ground until long after noon next
day. The cannon were pulled through only by the toil of hundreds of
men at the drag ropes, or by laying on the worst places corduroy, or a
rough road of trees and brushwood. Many horses were mired and abandoned,
and scores of packs with precious bags of flour and ammunition
were lost. Altogether it was a most terrible experience, much worse than
in the Pennsylvania swamp, called “The Shades of Death,” which they
had traversed.</p>

<p>For years afterwards, that horrible night formed the blackest memory
and gave the most disturbing element to the dreams of the old soldiers.
In our time, as we travel through this drained and dry valley between the
green walls of the hills on either side, we wonder as we look over the
celery gardens where Bear Swamp was. Within half a century after
Sullivan’s march and return, the forests were cleared and the Chemung
canal, bearing millions of cubic feet of timber to the great cities, and
especially to build the Maryland privateers for the War of 1812, traversed
and drained the swamp. To-day smiling farms and vegetable
gardens on either side of the well laid beds of the steam railway and
electric trolley line fill the sunny and beautiful valley.</p>

<p>Just beyond this horrible swamp of 1779 lay the village of Sheaquaga,
or “French Catherine’s town,” three miles from Seneca Lake, on
the site of the present town of Havana, or Montour Falls. It was the
capital of the Indian Queen Catherine Montour, and contained her
“palace.” It consisted of about forty “long,” or apartment, houses of
timber and bark, with splendid cornfields, orchards, and fenced enclosures,
in which were horses, cows, calves and hogs. It looked as though the
army would have, for a little while at least, meat rations. Here had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</span>
the home of Catherine, sister of Queen Esther and granddaughter of
Adam Montour, who was the offspring of Count Frontenac. A Dutch
family had also lived here among the Indians. It seemed strange to our
men to find feather beds and other evidences of civilization so far in the
wilderness. Some of it was the plunder from Cherry Valley and
Wyoming.</p>

<p>The town was deserted, but our troops had to wait all day Thursday
for the pack horses and cattle that emerged one by one, or in parties, from
the darkness of the dreadful swamp. They found an old squaw, whom
they compelled to give information about the Indians. Then they built
for her a hut and left her some provisions. Moving northward along the
eastern shores of Seneca Lake, through open woods and level country,
they found corn roasting in the fire, their supper left untasted and all the
evidences of the hasty movement of a large body of Indians.</p>

<p>The next day they moved as far as North Hector, to a village
consisting of one very large apartment house with several rooms and
fires. To this day the new timber, grown up in the place of the old forest
cut through for the artillery, can be easily discerned. Resuming their
march, they came on Sunday, September 5, to Kendaia, or Apple Town.
This was an Indian village of the first class, over twenty large, long apartment
houses built of timber and bark, some of them well painted. There
were apple and peach orchards, with many hundreds of trees ripening
their fruit, and a cemetery, in which there were tombs erected to the chiefs
and made of hewn and painted planks. Here they met with a white
captive, Luke Sweetland, whom the Indians had kept employed in making
salt. All this lake region is underlaid with beds of the purest chloride of
sodium, and in times of peace the Senecas and Onondagas drove a thriving
trade with the other tribes in this necessity of life. They made their salt
by boiling the brine from salt springs. To-day at Ithaca and Ludlowville
the white crystals fill daily a freight train.</p>

<p>On the sixth of September the evening gun sounded at Indian
Hollow. On the seventh day they reached the great Seneca town of
Kanadesaga, lying on both sides of Castle Creek near what is now Geneva,
N. Y. Here had dwelt Old Smoke, the Indian King, and his son who
married a daughter of Catherine Montour. In 1756, during the Old
French War, Sir William Johnson had built a fort, or stockade, in this
town, which was regularly laid out with the open square, in which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</span>
fort stood, in the center. Orchards and gardens were plentiful, especially
on the north and northeast. Although Sullivan had expected to fight a
battle here, and had deployed his regiments for assault, yet the town was
found to be entirely deserted, except that a little white boy three years old,
captured from one of the settlements, was found playing, though nearly
starved. The circular mound, on which the councils of the chiefs and
orators were held, still stands, a monument of a nearly vanished race.
Gleefully the troops marched in and through the town, with pumpkins and
squashes skewered on their bayonets.</p>

<p>The Continentals were now in that renowned lake region of New
York famous among the Indians not only for its salt springs, but for its
abundance of fish and fruit, and the general fertility of the soil. The
forest was still dense all around them, except the more frequent openings,
but the Indian villages were numerous and with luxuriant vegetable
gardens. In these, onions, peas, beans, squashes, potatoes, turnips, cabbages,
cucumbers, watermelons, carrots and parsnips were plentiful, while
great cornfields stretched farther off into the clearings and to the very edge
of the forest, and orchards of apple, peach and mulberry trees were within
easy reach.</p>

<p>It was this great store of vegetable food found everywhere ready
that decided Sullivan and his brigade commanders, after a council of war,
to push on further westward, despite the very scanty supplies of meat and
flour rations. So the horses and the men unable to proceed further by
reason of sickness or lameness, were sent back to the fort at Tioga Point,
Captain Reed of Massachusetts with fifty men forming the escort. Thence
he was to return again, as we have seen, to Kanawaholla, near the present
city of Elmira, with supplies for the army on its return.</p>

<p>The main army, facing the setting sun, camped at Flint Creek September
9, and on the next day at noon reached Canandaigua, so named
because here the trading Indians on the trail, or red commercial travellers
on the road, “took off their pack” to rest. It was an Indian town of
twenty-three large houses, with standing crops, all of which, as at the
other places, were given to the torch. It is said that the women and
pappooses hid themselves on Squaw Island, in the lake near the town.
On Saturday, September 11, the Stars and Stripes were unfurled at the
foot of Honeoye Lake, where stood the Indian village of twenty long
houses. All these except one, selected for a fortified storehouse, were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</span>
set on fire. The walls of this strongest dwelling were still further
strengthened with kegs and bags of flour, and a ditch dug and <i>abatis</i> made.
Then two three pounders were mounted and their black noses poked out
of the port holes cut through the walls. Here the sick and disabled,
amounting to nearly three hundred, were left, in camp. The weakest
found quarters in the rooms and bunks of the Indian house. Then the whole
army, now able to move as a light armed corps, pressed forward to the
goal, which was the big Indian town in the Genesee river valley, near what
is now Cuylerville, below Geneseo, N. Y. Delayed by storm and rain next
day, only eleven miles were made to Adjuton, a village of eighteen houses,
near Conesus Lake, where had lived two celebrities, Captain Sunfish, a
negro, and Big Tree, a Seneca chief. The fresh evidences of savages
near at hand, were very manifest on the Indian path leading to the
Genesee town.</p>

<p>It may be wondered what had become of the motley British force
after their defeat at Newtown. As a matter of fact, two hundred fresh
Indian warriors had joined Brant just after the battle. They were clamorous
to advance at once against the Americans, but those who had a taste
of grape shot and bursting bombs were unwilling to make a stand. So
the whole force of red and white allies of King George had retreated to
the north and west, making camp near Avon, in Livingston County.
Keeping out their scouts on the hilltops, they were well informed of
Sullivan’s movements.</p>

<p>Now, knowing that he had left Conesus, evidently to attack the big
town of the Senecas, Brant and Butler chose a strong position. It was
remarkably like that of Braddock’s field, in Pennsylvania, wherein the
pride of England’s infantry were changed, from red-coated soldiers, in
the glory of lusty life, to heaps of bleaching bones. On a bluff, parallel
with the western side of Conesus Lake, well forested, but full of deep
ravines, Butler posted his men in ambush. He hoped that Sullivan would
advance with his men up the well known trail between two ravines. He
had broken down the old, rude bridge over the stream, but he knew that
the Continental pioneers would be likely to build another out of the oak
and hickory which abounded here. Here he expected to post his men and
watch for the opportunity when the scouts should announce the nearness
of Sullivan, who was without artillery. With his fresh reinforcements
Butler was confident of victory.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>IN THE AMERICAN COLONIES BEFORE THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR, WITH
PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO CONDITIONS IN THE ROYAL COLONY
OF NEW YORK.</p>
</div>


<h3>CHAPTER VI—<i>Concluded</i></h3>

<p>It is also important to remember that the press appealed to a very much
smaller percentage of the population in colonial times than it does
to-day. “In Boston with a population of 8000, Campbell succeeded
in selling but 3000 copies of his News Letters when it was the only
newspaper printed in America.”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Later the circulation of all the papers
increased, but it was still but a small proportion of the colonists who
received first hand the opinions of the editor. And this body of subscribers
was for the most part of the professional class or the wealthier part of
those in trade, persons naturally of a conservative temper and apt to look
with disfavor on any strong attack on or disregard of legalized and
established authority.</p>

<p>In New York, owing to the peculiar way in which the press was
introduced, it for the first forty years of its existence did nothing to put
itself in antagonism to the government; in Massachusetts it at first was
given a subvention by the General Court; in South Carolina a comparatively
large sum was offered to any printer who would brave the dangers
of the climate and establish a press. With these exceptions its early days
were passed under governments which viewed with dislike or suspicion
any attempts on the part of the printers to take an intelligent part in the
questions that were interesting the people. For this reason the press in
all the colonies early assumed a position of antagonism to the constituted
authority and in return the government took every opportunity to hurt
it by means of prosecutions in the courts or inquisitorial proceedings
before the Governor and his Council. It is interesting to note however
that these proceedings lost almost all their terrors as the period of the
Revolution approached, for the press received more and more the support
of the people, who had learned to appreciate the wide circulation which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</span>
the newspapers gave to the new doctrines; thus we constantly find the
grand juries refusing to find true bills against the printers, in this way
reducing the Governor to the use of Informations which were looked on
with suspicion by the people and seldom resulted in a verdict of Guilty.</p>

<p>But the greatest influence of the press was exerted through the flood
of hand-bills and pamphlets which ever increased in volume as the period
of the Revolution drew near. Printed in large numbers and circulating
everywhere, we find Governors reporting to the home government that it
was impossible to stop them, and that they were doing incalculable harm.</p>

<p>If now we attempt in a very brief way to review the whole matter
of the struggle for the liberty of the press we shall find:</p>

<p>First: That the system in vogue in America, as in England, up to
the close of the seventeenth century, was a system of administrative control
by the Crown through appointed officers called Censors, to whom
all writings had to be submitted before publication and who either gave or
refused permission to print. That this Censorship was shared by Church
and State in some instances only complicated the situation.</p>

<p>Second: With the failure to pass the Licensing Bill in 1695 the press
became in all parts of the English dominion freed from this censorship;
but a system of judicial control took its place, for all publications were
now subject to the law of libel, and an attack on the dominant party was
held by the courts to be a libel, and a censure of the Governor to be a personal
reflection on the King. In Franklin’s case in England in 1731,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
it was laid down by Lord Raymond that the court alone was to judge of
the criminality of a libel, to the jury was given only the right to decide as
to the fact of publication.</p>

<p>In England that doctrine continued in force until the passage of
Mr. Fox’s Libel Bill in 1792. But fifty-eight years earlier the Zenger
case (in 1734) had established in principle the freedom of the press in
the colonies, by settling the right of juries to find a general verdict in libel
cases. We have said “in principle,” for this right, which the colonists
soon grew to consider as a part of their common law, was yet in practice
more or less nullified in the different colonies according as the Governor
was able to impose his will on the courts or was opposed by an intelligent
public opinion.</p>

<p>In other words, liberty of the press did not and could not exist in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</span>
the colonial period, but the people accepted the principle and when they
obtained the opportunity incorporated it in Bills of Rights and State Constitutions.
The Continental Congress in issuing, on Oct. 21st, 1774, an
“Address to the people of Canada” proceeded to detail and enlarge upon
the rights to which English subjects were entitled, and among them placed
the freedom of the press.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>We see the same point made by State after State.</p>

<p>Maryland, 1776: “That the liberty of the press ought to be inviolably
preserved.”</p>

<p>Virginia, 1776: “That the freedom of the press is one of the great
bulwarks of liberty, and can never be restrained but by despotic
governments.”</p>

<p>Pennsylvania, 1776: “That the people have a right to freedom of
speech, and of writing, and of publishing their sentiments; therefore the
freedom of the press ought not to be restrained.”</p>

<p>Georgia, 1777: “Freedom of the press and trial by jury to remain
inviolable forever.”</p>

<p>Vermont, 1777: “That the public have the right to freedom of
speech and of writing and publishing their sentiments; therefore the freedom
of the press ought not to be restrained.”</p>

<p>South Carolina, 1778: “That the liberty of the press be inviolably
preserved.”</p>

<p>Massachusetts, 1780: “The liberty of the press is essential to the
security of freedom in a state; and ought not, therefore, to be restrained
in this commonwealth.”</p>

<p>New Hampshire, 1784: “The liberty of the press is essential to the
security of freedom in a state; and it ought, therefore, to be inviolably
preserved.”</p>

<p>Pinckney’s Plan of 1787: “The Legislature of the United States
shall pass no law touching or abridging the liberty of the press.”</p>

<p>Delaware, 1792: “The press shall be free to every citizen who
undertakes to examine the official conduct of men acting in a public<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</span>
capacity, and any citizen may print on any subject, being responsible for
the abuse of that liberty. In prosecutions for publications investigating
the proceedings of officers, or where the matter published is proper for
public information, the truth thereof may be given in evidence; and in
all indictments for libels, the jury may determine the facts and the law,
as in other cases.”</p>

<p>After the Federal Convention came together in 1787 it was proposed
to insert in the Constitution, “the liberty of the press shall be inviolably
preserved.” This was defeated by six states against five.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> But when
the different States afterwards sent to the first Congress the proposals
from which the first ten Amendments were selected we find in nearly all
some reference to the liberty of the press. The article on the subject
from Massachusetts was selected and now appears as a part of the First
Amendment to the Constitution, “Congress shall make no law ...
abridging the freedom of speech or of the press.”<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> And since that time
nearly every Constitution drawn up by the different States has contained
an admission of the principle so long contended for by supporters of
the rights of the press, that, as David Hume says, “its liberties, and the
liberties of the people must stand or fall together.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="RELICS_OF_COMMODORE_JOHN_BARRY_IN">RELICS OF COMMODORE JOHN BARRY IN
PHILADELPHIA</h2>
</div>


<p>Apropos of the proposed erection here of a monument to the
memory of Commodore John Barry, it is interesting to know that
in addition to his tomb in St. Mary’s Churchyard, on Fourth
street below Locust, where he was buried, there are many other relics
of the great naval commander in this city, which was his home and
where he maintained both a town and country residence. In Fairmount
Park, too, is a monument not known to many people, where one of the
five figures of the fountain erected by the Catholic Total Abstinence Society
is a statue of Barry. It is of heroic size and the inscription, besides
reciting some of his principal exploits on the sea, describes him as the
first commodore of the United States navy.</p>

<p>Nearly all the other relics are in the possession of Mrs. W. Horace
Hepburn of this city, who is a great-grandniece of Barry, and also a
granddaughter of Commodore Bainbridge, and to whom they have been
handed down. They are of many kinds and, taken altogether, would
form quite a museum. Some of them are particularly valuable as records
of history, among these being the logs of the <i>Alliance</i> and other warships
which Barry commanded. Another documentary relic is the commission
as captain and commander of the frigate <i>United States</i> issued to Barry
to “take rank from the fourth day of June, 1804.” It is dated February
22, 1797, however, and is signed by Washington. On the margin it is
numbered “one,” showing it to have been the first captain’s commission
issued in the navy of the new constitutional government.</p>

<p>Of nearly equal importance as a record is the certificate of Barry’s
membership in the Society of the Cincinnati. With this Mrs. Hepburn
has also the handsome jewelled badge of the order presented to him by
Lafayette. It is in the regular form of the organization’s emblem, but
is very ornate. It was manufactured in France. Also in Mrs. Hepburn’s
possession is Stuart’s original portrait, a copy of which, by Colin
Campbell Cooper, was presented to the city by the Hibernian Society in
1895, and now hangs in Independence Hall. The Stuart portrait was
painted in this city.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</span></p>

<p>Among the relics is a set of china, much of which was used on the
frigate <i>Alliance</i>. Among these is a punch bowl and pitcher in white
china, with a good picture of the frigate under full sail on each. This
china was probably made in France, but that point has not as yet been
definitely determined. What were also probably used on the ship are a
number of glass goblets and other glassware, which are not particularly
fine as to design and manufacture, but are none the less cherished as
relics. There is also a considerable quantity of French china, with the
monogram S. B., for Sarah Barry, on it, and a number of dinner plates,
which were probably used in his house. Pertaining more closely to the
commander’s seafaring career are one of his swords, a gun, and a full-dress
uniform, the latter consisting of yellow nankeen knee breeches and
vest, with a blue frock coat with immense brass buttons. The size of
these garments emphasizes the well-known fact that the commodore was
a very large man. Originally among the relics were a pair of silver knee
buckles, which, before the collection came into the hands of its present
owner, were melted down and made into teaspoons. How big they were
may be inferred from the fact that they made six spoons. Mrs. Hepburn
has these spoons, but says she would much prefer to have the silver
in its original form of buckles. Commodore Barry’s watch is also in the
collection, as is a large solid silver ale tankard, which was probably used
on land.</p>

<p>Barry’s tomb in St. Mary’s churchyard is one of the most impressive
mementos of him because of the inscription which it bears. The original
tomb was erected by the commodore’s widow, but this became dilapidated
through the ravages of time and the inscription, written by Dr. Benjamin
Rush, a copy of which has been preserved in the Ridgeway branch of the
Philadelphia Library, was barely decipherable as early as 1865. In 1876
the tomb was repaired, and now bears the following inscription:</p>

<p>“Sacred to the memory of Commodore John Barry, father of the
American navy. Let the Christian patriot and soldier who visits these
mansions of the dead view this monument with respect and veneration.
Beneath it rest the remains of John Barry, who was born in County
Wexford, Ireland, in the year 1745. America was the object of his
patriotism, and the aim of his usefulness and ambition. At the beginning
of the Revolutionary War he held the commission of captain in the then
limited navy of the colonies. His achievements in battle and his renowned
naval tactics merited for him the position of commodore, and to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</span>
justly regarded as the father of the American navy. He fought often
and bled in the cause of freedom, but his deeds of valor did not diminish
in him the virtues which adorned his private life. He was eminently
gentle, kind, just, and charitable, and no less beloved by his family and
friends than by his grateful country. Firm in the faith and practices of
the Roman Catholic Church, he departed this life on the 13th day of
September, 1803, in the fifty-ninth year of his age. In grateful remembrance,
a few of his countrymen, members of St. Mary’s Church and
others, have contributed towards this second monument, erected July 1,
1876. <i>Requiescat in Pace.</i>”</p>

<p>Commodore Barry’s deeds as a naval officer, the fact that he commanded
the <i>Lexington</i>, the first armed cruiser; that he captured and
brought to Philadelphia the first prize; that he fought the last naval
battle, and many other such points in his brilliant record, are all embalmed
in the nation’s history. In private life he was a loyal friend and
a good citizen, social in his tastes, hearty in his manner, and genial to all.
He was a sailor before joining our navy, having been placed in the
merchant marine service by his father when a mere boy. He came to
this country when probably about twenty-one years old, reaching Philadelphia
from the island of Barbados, in command of the schooner <i>Barbados</i>.
This was ten years before the Revolution, and from that time
until the opening of the war he followed his career in these waters, and
in command of vessels sailing between here and England. He was twice
married, and both wives were buried in the same grave in St. Mary’s
churchyard. His second wife, Sarah Austin, and her sister, Mary, are
said to have made and presented to John Paul Jones the flag of the <i>Bon
Homme Richard</i>. Commodore Barry died in 1803, at his country residence,
“Strawberry Hill.” This was not the Strawberry Hill in Fairmount
Park, but was located on Frankford Road, at Gunner’s Run. The
body was brought to his city residence, on the south side of Chestnut
Street, between Ninth and Tenth Streets, on a site about opposite the
<i>Record</i> building, where the funeral took place.—<i>Philadelphia Record.</i></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="BUSHNELLS_TURTLE">BUSHNELL’S “TURTLE”</h2>
</div>


<p>The successful use in the Russian-Japanese war (as is supposed, for
no official statement has come from the Japanese officials) of submarine
boats has obscured the historic fact that one hundred and
thirty years ago the first attempt of the kind was made in the harbor of
New York.</p>

<p>It is a fact that is not generally known, but which is of official record—that
the first serious attempt in this line was the work of a Yale undergraduate.
It was while a freshman at Yale, in the year 1771, that David
Bushnell, an ingenious Connecticut boy, conceived the idea of a submarine
vessel as a desirable means of defensive warfare. He kept at the problem
throughout the four years of his college course, and by the time of his
graduation, in 1775, had made several successful trial trips with his
<i>American Turtle</i>, as his peculiar contrivance was called. The plans of
this vessel were carefully examined a few years ago by Commander F. W.
Barber, U. S. N., whose conclusion was that “it seems to have been the
most perfect thing of its kind that has ever been constructed, either before
or since the time of Bushnell.” Bushnell invented not only the first submarine
boat of which there is any intelligent record, but the first torpedo
as well. He discovered the principle of modern torpedo-mining—that
is, the utilization of the pressure of the water to develop the desirable intensity
of action in an explosion near the vessel to be destroyed. Furthermore,
he was the first man to give the torpedo its modern name. All
these triumphs he accomplished while an undergraduate student at Yale.</p>

<p>He gathered an assemblage of what he called “the first personages in
Connecticut” to prove to them that this strange thing could be done. He
first exploded two ounces of powder four feet under water, and later blew
up a hogshead filled with stones, a wooden bottle, and a two-inch oak
plank, greatly to the astonishment of his learned associates. After this
preliminary display of what he could do, young Bushnell’s theories were
held in greater respect throughout the rest of his college course. He
had one great idea, however, and this was the possibility of constructing
a boat that could sail under the enemy’s ship, attach to it a magazine with
a sufficient charge of powder to destroy the vessel and all its men—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</span>
operator, meanwhile, getting safely away. He kept hard at work
throughout his four undergraduate years, and by the time he was graduated
had constructed such a machine and experimented with the most
encouraging success.</p>

<p>He finished his vessel at an opportune time. He had its complicated
mechanism complete and in fine running order when the Declaration of
Independence was signed, and the war between England and America
was under full way. He naturally had some difficulty in gaining a respectful
hearing from the leading men on the colonial side. Although afterwards
he was praised by Washington as “a man of great mechanical
powers, fertile in inventions, and a master of execution,” his first real
encouragement came from another Connecticut man, Israel Putnam.
Bushnell explained his contrivance to Putnam, who after carefully examining
the vessel, was much struck with its ingenuity and its possibilities of
success. He gave the young inventor full permission to go ahead, and
declared his intention of being present at the first trial.</p>

<p>The occasion for this preliminary experiment was soon at hand. The
movements of General Washington about Long Island had been accompanied
by the arrival of a large British fleet from Halifax under Admiral
Lord Howe, brother of the commander of the British army. Putnam
had been left with 4000 men in New York, and sent for Bushnell, inviting
him to test his submarine boat against one of the enemy’s ships.
Bushnell was himself physically incapacitated from managing his machine,
for it required considerable strength. He had, however, taught his
brother its fine points, and the latter in many trials had demonstrated his
skill. At the critical time, however, the latter fell ill of a fever and a
substitute had to be found. Ezra Lee of Lyme, Conn., was finally decided
upon as the fittest man for the place. Lee had already volunteered
to go in a fire-ship, and his bravery was unquestioned. Bushnell spent
several days teaching Lee the management of the boat—altogether too
short a time, as subsequent events showed. The British fleet lay a little
above Staten Island, the flagship, against which it was determined to
operate being the <i>Eagle</i>.</p>

<p>It was a queer craft, the like of which no man had ever seen, in which
Ezra Lee embarked one dark night in August, 1776, with the firm intention
of destroying the pick of the British fleet. Its shape suggested a
turtle or rather two upper turtle shells, securely fastened together.
A brass crown, resembling a hat, represented the head of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</span>
turtle; it was provided with glass windows, which supplied light
while the boat was on the surface, and with several round doors,
which were opened before submersion for the admission of air. The
turtle rested in the water with its tail downwards, being held in position
by a permanent lead ballast in the hold of 500 pounds. This was supplemented
by 200 pounds of the same metal, which could be released at
the will of the navigator, enabling him to rise suddenly to the surface.
The turtle was made of oak, put together in the strongest manner; it was
seven and one-half feet long and six feet high. It admitted only one person,
who had room enough either to stand up or sit down. There were
two air-tubes, one for letting the fresh air in and another for letting the
foul air out. These were ingeniously arranged so that they operated
whenever the boat was brought to the surface and closed immediately
after it was submerged. There were no means of generating or supplying
air while the contrivance was under water. Sufficient atmosphere to
last the operator thirty minutes was supplied before the trial began, after
the exhaustion of which he was obliged to rise to the surface.</p>

<p>The question of light presented a still greater difficulty. A candle
exhausting the air too rapidly, Bushnell was obliged to find some less embarrassing
substitute. He finally noted the points of the compass by two
pieces of fox-fire wood—that is, wood that emitted a phosphoric light.
The same method was used to determine the depth of the water. For
this Bushnell constructed a peculiar contrivance, the secret of which is
unknown, consisting of a glass tube, filled with water, in which a cork
floated up and down. This cork was also covered with fox-fire, and by
its rise and fall the operator could determine the depth to which his vessel
was submerged. The boat was propelled back and forth by a paddle in
front, shaped like the arm of a windmill. The operator turned this with
a crank, and could go either forwards or backwards, as he desired. It
was precisely the same principle as the modern screw, with the exception
that it was placed in the bow instead of the stern of the boat. Another
“oar,” identically the same, was arranged at right angles with the first,
by means of which the vessel could be guided up or down. The progress
of the boat was necessarily slow, but it is said that a strong man, with a
favoring tide and current, could propel it three knots an hour. The rudder,
also turned by a crank, could be used for sculling when desired. In
the bottom of the vessel were two large water tanks, into which the water
was let by a spring. It was by this means that the boat made its descent.
There were two pumps, which the operator worked with his feet, for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</span>
expulsion of the water when he desired to rise. In case these failed to
work, the two hundred pounds of lead on the bottom could be released,
after which the rise was very sudden. The operator sat upright, with his
head in the crown of the vessel, and by a dexterous use of his hands and
feet, had little difficulty in completely mastering his boat. It required
considerable practice, however, and unusual strength.</p>

<p>This was Bushnell’s submarine boat, but it was only one feature of
his invention. His other discovery, the torpedo, was ingeniously combined
with his vessel. On the stern of the boat, just above the rudder, on
the outside, was a large cask, made of two pieces of oak, carefully caulked
and tarred, and bound together with iron. The interior was dug out and
contained a charge of powder. Within was a gun-lock, which was arranged
to strike fire whenever a clock-work attachment ran down. The
magazine was fastened to the boat by a screw, which could be unscrewed
from within. It was contrived so that when the magazine should be disengaged
from the vessel the clock-work should be set agoing. The clock-work
ran down in about thirty minutes, when the gun-lock went off and
ignited the charge. A short cable attached the magazine to another screw
in the top of the vessel. From within the operator could fasten this screw
into the bottom of a vessel and fill his own boat at the same time. He
could, therefore, sail safely away, leaving the magazine attached to the
bottom of the enemy’s man-of-war, and await developments.</p>

<p>There was no evident reason why the attempt upon the <i>Eagle</i> should
not have a satisfactory issue. Sergeant Lee was obliged to wait several
nights for a favorable opportunity. Finally, at eleven o’clock one night
in August, he embarked on his dangerous voyage. General Putnam was
on the wharf when he pushed off, and kept a constant watch throughout
the next few hours. Lee was towed by whale-boats as near the ships as
the oarsmen dared to go, and was then cast off. He discovered that it
was too early to make the attempt. The tide was running strong, and,
in spite of all that he could do, it carried him far beyond the ships. He
rowed aimlessly around until the tide slowed up, when he made directly
for the man-of-war. He drew so near under the stern of the ships that
he could see the British sailors and hear their voices. At a favorable
moment he let the water into the reservoirs and sank. Everything up to
this point worked splendidly. He had no difficulty in managing his boat
under the water, and took up a favorable position directly under the keel
of the man-of-war, near the stern. He at once proceeded to attach the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</span>
screw to the bottom of the vessel, when he struck a formidable opposition.
He had not figured on the copper with which the bottom of the ship was
covered, and which resisted all his attempts to fasten the screw. At every
attempt the boat rebounded from the vessel’s bottom. Lee finally moved
to another part of the ship, and in so doing lost his hold completely, and
rose with tremendous velocity to the surface. He came within two or
three feet of the man-of-war, upon whose destruction he had been bent—a
rather uncomfortable circumstance, especially as it was nearly daylight.
He at once, therefore, filled the reservoirs and sank again. As it would
soon be morning, however, and as he had four miles to row, he decided
to abandon his attempt to blow up the man-of-war, and instead to look
out for his own safety. Bushnell never blamed Lee for his failure to
execute the plan, owing to the fact that he had had such slight preparation
for the task.</p>

<p>There was naturally much disappointment over this initial failure,
and especially when a British frigate came up and anchored off Bloomingdale,
and Lee made another equally unsuccessful attempt. His intention
this time was to go up to the stern of the vessel and, without sinking,
screw in his magazine close to the edge. Discovered by the watch, he
dove under the frigate, but went too deep and came up on the other side.
In the year 1777, however, Bushnell sent one of his machines against the
<i>Cerberus</i>, a British frigate, lying at anchor between New London and the
mouth of the Connecticut River. The machine instead fell in with a
schooner, anchored astern of the frigate, which had escaped Bushnell’s observation.
It blew up the schooner, completely demolishing it, and killed
three men. Bushnell was very much cast down by the failure of his contrivance,
which he believed had never had a fair show. At the end of the
war he went to France, and was present during the stirring scenes of the
Revolution. His relatives lost all track of him, and supposed that he had
died in a French prison or upon the guillotine, until, in 1826, they received
information of his death in Georgia.</p>

<p class="center">[<i>Concluded from January Number.</i>]</p>


<p>At the end of the “Western Insurrection,” in 1794, General White
issued the following address to the troops:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<span class="smcap">Bedford (Pa.)</span>, <i>December 5, 1794</i>.<br>
</p>

<p>The dismission and sudden departure of the Cavalry, by Troops,
from Pittsburgh to their respective states and counties, prevented the
General of Cavalry from conveying in Orders, at that place and period,
the thanks and good wishes of the Commander-in-Chief, so handsomely
and friendly expressed in the following extract from his Excellency’s last
Orders, viz.: “To the Officers of every description he presents his
warmest thanks, for the faithful and able support which he has derived
from their exertion, in every stage of the execution of the objects intrusted
to his direction; and he intrusts them to convey to his fellow-soldiers, in
the most lively terms, his respectful attachment, and his best wishes for
their safe return, and happy meeting with their friends.”</p>

<p>This praise, though flattering and justly due, cannot equal the self-approbation
every good citizen must experience, who has taken so decided
a part to check rebellion, restore order, and establish the best of Constitutions.
The nature of Cavalry service directed the propriety of ordering
a separation of the Brigade, after passing the mountains, and now affords
the General an opportunity of congratulating those officers, who were
favoured with separate commands, on the success attending the design of
the separation; as it must be acknowledged, that the Brigade of Cavalry,
with those three very respectable Troops from the city of Philadelphia,
commanded by Captains Dunlap, Singer, and M’Connel, capturing in
one day, and almost at the same hour, every Insurgent of the western
counties of Pennsylvania, who had not previously fled from Justice, or
signed a submission to the laws to which they had so basely encouraged
an opposition. The complete execution of this enterprise expresses, in
lively colours, the great address of the Cavalry Officers, and the military
prowess of their respective Commands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</span></p>

<p>Deign, fellow-citizens and brother-soldiers, who have acted under
the General’s Orders, to accept of his warmest thanks for the cheerfulness
and promptitude you have shown in obeying and executing his Orders.
The satisfaction he experienced in commanding you can never be erased
from his mind. This became sometimes painful, by observing old military
rank, gray hairs, wealth, and character, placed, by choice, in a subordinate
situation, which unpleasant circumstance could only be removed
by beholding, at the same time, such honourable evidence of this fact, that
a true American will never embrace considerations of this kind, to shield
him from dangers and hardships, when called to support the laws of his
country, should they ever again be insulted or opposed by any men or set
of men, wickedly combined for that purpose. Dictates of Justice direct
the General of Cavalry to request Doctor Charles Smith, Brigade Surgeon;
Major Carle, Inspector of the Brigade; Major Samuel Clarkson,
Brigade-Quarter-Master, and Major John Striker, Brigade-Forage-Master,
to accept his thanks, for the attention they have paid to their
respective departments. Acknowledgements are also due from the General
to Le Chevalier D’Auterroches, his Aid-de-Camp, and to Brigade-Major
Dunham and Coejeman, for their faithful services. Colonels
Hubley and Gibbons, who honoured the General with acting under his
Orders as volunteer Brigade-Majors, will likewise please to accept his
unfeigned thanks for the aid he received from them. Major James
Dunham, who has the honour to bring up the rear of the Army, and is
intrusted with the deposite of their victories, has fully merited that honour,
by the great attention and humanity shown, by him, to those unfortunate
prisoners under his immediate charge; which has been often noticed
by the General, with the greatest satisfaction, during the march to this
place; and speaks in strong language, the goodness of the Major’s heart.
A continuation of the same attention, with every precaution for the safety
of those unhappy instruments of designing men, is warmly recommended,
till they shall be delivered up to the Marshal of the state of Pennsylvania.
To every individual of the Cavalry, whom the General has had the
honour to command, he now bids an affectionate farewell; and sincerely
wishes them every domestic happiness.</p>

<p>On Monday, the 26th, seventy-five officers of the New Jersey cavalry,
met in this city and dined together at the White Hall Tavern, His Excellency
the Governor and suite honored them with their company at dinner,
after which fifteen toasts were drank. The next day all the officers waited
on General White, delivered the following address to him, and partook of
a cold collation at his house.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<span class="smcap">Sir.</span><br>
</p>

<p>With unfeigned satisfaction, we embrace this occasion, the earliest
we have been able to command, to make our warmest acknowledgements
to you for the very polite and friendly sentiment conveyed to us in your
last cavalry orders. This public testimony of your partiality to us and
interest in our happiness, has been fully evinced in many trying circumstances.
Raw and undisciplined as we were, to have met the approbation
of one, so complete in military science, cannot but vastly enhance the
pleasing sensations we derive, from having lent a willing aid in support
of our happy constitution. If we have acted with a degree of reputation
to ourselves; if we have rendered service to our country, to you sir, are we
much indebted for both these advantages. Your activity, combined with
an extensive knowledge of your important duties, have at all times
been eminently conspicuous; your zeal for the public good, and an affectionate
regard for the honor and happiness of the New Jersey cavalry,
have been too well noticed and too sincerely approved, ever to be effaced
from our remembrance. To see the man, who has spent years in a continued
struggle for freedom, and bled in asserting our dearest rights,
again at the call of his country, step forward with that ardent enthusiasm
which true liberty ever inspires, did not fail to command our grateful
admiration and render us emulous of such virtue. May that sacred flame
of liberty which you have been so instrumental in lighting up and supporting,
long burn bright in this new world and extend its genial influence
from continent to continent, until tyranny shall disappear and the whole
world would be emancipated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</span></p>

<p>Accept sir, our warmest approbation of your conduct and our sincere
prayer that your life may be long continued, as useful to your country,
an honor to the New Jersey Cavalry, and full of every comfort to
yourself.</p>

<p>In behalf of the officers of the New Jersey Cavalry on the late

<p>To which the General replied: That the polite and affectionate
address of his fellow citizens and brother soldiers, expressing their approbation
of his conduct added to the heart felt satisfaction he had already
experienced from his late honourable commands, claimed our warmest
acknowledgements, and sincerely wish that they might enjoy every happiness
and a tender of his friendship and services.</p>

<p>The officers spent several days together in that harmony and true
friendship, to be expected only from men warmly interested in the good
of their country, and the happiness of each other.</p>

<p>Judge Paterson, Major General Dayton and several gentlemen and
officers of character and distinction, visited the social board of this

Quay of Monmouth, Major Dunham of Middlesex, Captain Vanderveer
of Somerset, and Captains Wollcot and Shute of the Western counties, a

General may please to fix.</p>

this State, waited upon the President of the United States, and, in behalf
of the officers of the New Jersey Militia, presented the following address:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<span class="smcap">Sir.</span><br>
</p>

<p>The Commander-in-Chief, the General Officers, the General Staff
and Field Officers of the Militia of the State of New Jersey, feel in common
with their numerous fellow citizens who have addressed you in the
present critical situation of our nation, and most cordially join them in expressing
to you their high approbation of your conduct in the management
of its foreign concerns, and their indignation for the insult offered to
the honor and independence of the American people.</p>

<p>We come not, Sir, to dictate—whether peace can be preserved with
the safety of our national dignity, or whether an appeal is to be made to
arms, are questions intrusted to those in whose patriotism we confide, and
according to their decision we shall always be prepared to act. But,
Sir, at this eventful period, we deem it our duty, and feel it a pleasure,
respectfully to approach our Commander-in-Chief, and to make him a
solemn proffer of our lives and fortunes in the service of our country. It
is not, Sir, for soldiers to boast; but we know the troops whom we have
the honor to command; we have been eye witnesses to their zeal in the
cause of freedom; we have been their companions in many toils and many
sufferings, and if our beloved country calls, we shall again cast the eye of
confidence along their embattled ranks.</p>

<p>Let our enemies flatter themselves that we are a divided people. In
New Jersey, Sir, with the exception of a few degraded and a few deluded
characters, to whose persons and to whose services the invading foe shall
be welcome the moment of their arrival, and whom we engage to convey
in safety to their lines—in New Jersey, Sir, there is but ONE VOICE,
and that is the voice of confidence in the federal government: the voice of
perfect satisfaction with your administration of it; and the voice of firmness
and determination to support the laws and constitution, the honor
and dignity of the United States; and, Sir, for the defence of these, we do
this day, in the presence of the God of armies, and in firm reliance in his
protection, solemnly pledge to you our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred
honor.</p>

<p>Among all the numerous addresses which have been presented to
me, in the present critical situation of our nation, there has been none
which has done me more honor, none animated with a more glowing love
of our country, or expressive of sentiments more determined and magnanimous.
The submission you avow to the civil authority, an indispensable
principle in the character of warriors in a free government, at the
same moment when you make a solemn proffer of your Lives and Fortunes
in the service of your country, is highly honorable to your dispositions
as Citizens and Soldiers, and proves you perfectly qualified for the
duties of both characters. Officers and Soldiers of New Jersey have as
little occasion as they have disposition to boast. Their country has long
boasted of their ardent zeal in the cause of freedom and their invincible intrepidity
in the day of battle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</span></p>

<p>Your voice of confidence and satisfaction, of firmness and determination
to support the laws and Constitution of the United States, has a
charm in it irresistible to the feelings of every American bosom; but,
when in the presence of the God of armies, and in firm reliance on his
protection, you solemnly pledge your lives and fortunes and sacred honor,
you have recorded words which ought to be indelibly imprinted in the
memory of every American youth.—With these sentiments in the hearts,
and this language in the mouths of Americans in general, the greatest
nation may menace at its pleasure, and the degraded and deluded characters
may tremble lest they should be condemned to the severest punishment
an American can suffer—that of being conveyed in safety within the
lines of an invading enemy.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="WHERE_ARE_EVANGELINE_AND_GABRIEL_BURIED">WHERE ARE EVANGELINE AND GABRIEL BURIED?</h2>
</div>


<p>The priests and sextons of old St. Joseph’s, St. Mary’s and Holy
Trinity Churches, of Philadelphia, are often called upon by
visitors to the city, to point out the grave of Evangeline and her
lover, Gabriel, the delightful creatures of Longfellow’s fancy, in relating
the expulsion of the Acadians from their happy homes and their dispersion
along the coast of the British provinces.</p>

<p>Of course, Gabriel and Evangeline are buried nowhere, as they never
existed, save in the imagination of the poet. The poem he calls “A Tale
of Acadie,” a “mournful tradition still sung by the pines of the forest.”
Still, it is astonishing that so many who have read the poem have believed
in the actuality of the tradition in its relation of chief characters, in its
Evangeline and her lover, and have sought their graves at these three
Catholic graveyards. St. Joseph’s now has no burial ground attached to
the church. It had originally, but after 1759 the dead of the congregation
were interred in the ground across the street, and, after 1763, called
St. Mary’s Street.</p>

<p>Longfellow’s poem represents the time of the meeting, death and
burial, as occurring during a pestilence. This was the yellow fever of
1793, as no general epidemic had occurred in the city from the time of the
coming of the Acadians in November, 1755, until that awful pestilence of
1793 ravaged the city.</p>

<p>But St. Joseph’s, in that year, had no burial ground at the church.
The latest interment I know of was that of Father Farmer, August, 1786.
Perhaps a few persons holding lots might have been permitted to inter in
that graveyard after the opening of St. Mary’s ground in 1759, but most
unlikely that Gabriel, an inmate of the city almshouse, would have been
brought there for burial, and later Evangeline laid in a grave “side by
side” by his.</p>

<p>So, though Old St. Joseph’s—mainly because it is called Old, and because
of the nearness of the Quakers’ Almshouse (torn down in 1874),
which many have supposed to have been the almshouse Longfellow had in
mind—is the most probable place of the burial of the lovers, in the belief<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</span>
of many, including usually well informed “Penn,” of the <i>Evening
Bulletin</i>, who, on October 12, 1898, declared that as Evangeline had long
been a Sister, who knew the city and its seamy side, she, like a good
Catholic, could have saved his body from being buried in the potter’s field,
and would have carried it to the ground of Old St. Joseph’s.</p>

<p>(It is to be remarked that Philadelphia had no Sisters of Mercy then,
nor Sisters of any Order until 1814, when the Sisters of Charity came from
Mrs. Seton’s to take charge of St. Joseph’s Orphan Asylum, on Sixth
Street.)</p>

<p>St. Mary’s, on Fourth Street, almost directly opposite to St. Joseph’s,
is not so often called at nor so frequently assigned as the supposed place
of interment.</p>

<p>To the opinions of those, who have supposed that either of these
“churchyards” was the one Longfellow had in mind when writing the
poem, I, years ago suggested that Holy Trinity Churchyard, on Sixth
Street, was the most likely place—the place most probable—the one which
Longfellow saw and years after had in mind.</p>

<p>The City Almshouse, at the time of the fever in 1793, was on Spruce
Street, south side, from Tenth to Eleventh Streets.</p>

<p>It was there when, in 1824, Longfellow visited the city.</p>

<p>On the same street from Eighth to Ninth, was then, and is now, the
Pennsylvania Hospital. Longfellow doubtless saw both, and the recollection
of either came to him when writing the poem, as the place where
Gabriel, dying, was attended to by Evangeline, in the city poorhouse.
Though there has been discussion as to which of these institutions Longfellow
had in mind, it could not be settled, because the poet, in writing to
Charles H. A. Esling, Esq., of Philadelphia, now a resident of Germany,
could not himself tell what building he had in mind.</p>

<p>But the point with us is as to where the lovers were buried. They
have so impressed countless thousands, that one may almost consider them
as actual personages, who lived and moved and died, and were buried in
our city—but where?</p>

<p>When it is remembered that the Pennsylvania Hospital and the City
Almshouse were both on Spruce Street, and that either of these could have
been the scene of the meeting of Evangeline and Gabriel, what is more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</span>
probable, that, as Longfellow walked Spruce Street, in 1824, he could, at
the western entrance of Holy Trinity church have glanced at the passageway
to the entrance of the church and seen as you can to-day see, the little
churchyard attached to it? Then passing eastward, to Sixth Street, and
turning northward, he had to pass the church, when again he saw “the
little Catholic churchyard”—the only such in the city in 1824, and the
smallest even to-day.</p>

<p>Remember, Longfellow, in describing the burial place of the lovers,
wrote:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Side by side, in their nameless graves, the lovers are sleeping,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Under the humble walls of the little Catholic churchyard.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In the heart of the city, they lie, unknown and unnoticed;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Daily the tides of life go ebbing and flowing beside them.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Mind, he says, “the little Catholic churchyard.” Many, I fear,
have thought of Old St. Joseph’s, “the little Catholic church,” and
so, have assigned to it the burial place, but it is “the little Catholic churchyard,”
which Longfellow speaks of, and the smallest such which Philadelphia
had in 1824, or could have had in 1793, the time of the pestilence,
was Holy Trinity, which dates from 1789. It best fills the probabilities
in the case: the almshouse at Tenth Street; the hospital at Eighth; the
little Catholic churchyard at Sixth Street.</p>

<p>The word “yard,” too, is important. He does not say Catholic
<i>graveyard</i>—but <i>churchyard</i>. Holy Trinity best fills the idea of a small
space attached to a building—a church—and having the commonly called
“yard,” a small enclosed place—in this case, at the side of the church,
right “under the humble walls.” No other Catholic churchyard in 1793,
could have been “under the walls” of any church but this. St. Joseph’s
had ceased to be a place of interment; St. Mary’s was, and yet is, a large
graveyard. It is not a “little churchyard,” and interments cannot be
said, even in imagination of poetry, to have been “under the walls” of
the church, as big in 1793 as to-day, save by about twenty feet.</p>

<p>While, of course, there was no real Evangeline or Gabriel in Philadelphia,
and no real burial anywhere, the sole discussion is confined to the
churchyard Longfellow saw, in 1824, and in 1847, had in mind as the
burial place of the two. No place so well fills the possibilities, even the
probability, as Holy Trinity’s “little churchyard,” at Sixth and Spruce.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</span></p>

<p>How Longfellow came to write Evangeline has been narrated; how
Lowell thought the “tradition” a fit one for a story, but that Longfellow
desired he be allowed to use it for a poem.</p>

<p>In “The Neutral French or the Exiles of Nova Scotia,” by Mrs.
Williams, issued in 1841, will be found the same story, but with New York
as the scene of action. That doubtless was the source of suggestion to
Longfellow.</p>

YORKTOWN</h2>
</div>


<p>Colonel Hazen’s regiment was the second regiment of the
kind and was known as “Congress’s Own,” because under authority
of a resolution of Congress of January 20, 1776, permission
was granted to enlist one thousand Canadians or more for one year, as
was done in a previous case under Colonel James Livingston. This regiment
was not chargeable to any State, and hence its name, “Congress’s
Own.” The troops were sometimes called “Canadian forces.”</p>

<p>Colonel Moses Hazen was appointed Colonel and Edward Antill
Lieutenant Colonel, by Congress. In the early part of 1776 about 500
Canadians were secured for the regiment; but the evacuation of Canada
reduced the number to less than 100 by the time it reached Albany.
Colonels Hazen and Antill then went to Philadelphia to lay the matter
before Congress. As a result they received authority to recruit anywhere
within the United States. Hazen went to New York and the New England
States; Antill to Pennsylvania and the Middle States. The latter
was the more successful in securing recruits.</p>

<p>In the early part of 1781 the regiment moved from West Point
down the Hudson and joined the army en route for Yorktown, when it
participated in the siege. After the surrender of Cornwallis it was
ordered to Lancaster, Pa., where for ten months it guarded English
prisoners. Then it moved to New York, and was finally disbanded at
White Plains in November, 1783.</p>

<p>In this regiment served James Duncan, first as a Lieutenant, commission
dated November 3, 1776, and next as Captain, commission dated
March 25, 1778.</p>

<p>James Duncan was a native of Philadelphia, where he was born in
1756. He graduated at Princeton College and was studying for the
ministry when the war broke out. As related by himself afterward, “The
beating of the d— drums past my window made such a noise that I could
not study;” so he concluded to enter the army. He became a member of
Colonel Hazen’s regiment, and continued with it till the close of the war.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</span>
For his services he received from Pennsylvania 500 acres of land. This
tract was situated in the Shenango valley, in what is now Mercer County.
When Adams County, Pa., was formed, Captain Duncan was appointed
first Prothonotary, and held the position until 1822. During the twenty-one
years he filled this office, he was never beyond the sight of his Court
House; and during that time he never opened his office at night nor
allowed a candle or lantern to be used in his office, so carefully did he
regard his duty to preserve the public records.</p>

<p>Captain Duncan removed to Mercer County, Pa., in 1822, and lived
there to the time of his death, which occurred June 24, 1844, in his 89th
year.</p>

<p>The diary which is here presented was kept by Captain Duncan with
great care. As a scholarly man and a good military officer, he was thoroughly
competent to make careful and reliable observations. These
memoranda were in his own handwriting. From this record the author
of this paper made an exact copy in 1899, and it is an important contribution
to the history of the Siege of Yorktown.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Camp Before York</span>, Oct. 2, 1781.—It may not be amiss to take notice of
a few remarkable occurrences prior to the commencement of this journal. The
army were never so universally deceived in regard to the operations of the campaign
as at this time. New York was thought to be the object, and no maneuver
left untried to confirm this opinion, when all on a sudden, the army decamped
from W. Plains, crossed the North river, and proceeded by a circuitous route to
Springfield, in New Jersey, where, after a halt of a few days (in order the better
to deceive the enemy), they took their route for Trenton, at which place the
artillery stores with our regiment and some other troops embarked. We were now
no longer at a loss to know our place of destination. We arrived at Christiana
Bridge and thence marched by land to the head of Elk, where the French troops
with the rest of our army joined us in a very short time. Here we were delayed
for 6 or 7 days, being busily employed in embarking ordnance stores of all kinds
on board the vessels. In the meantime the French troops with some other corps of
our army proceeded by land for Baltimore. The bay not being able to furnish
a sufficient number of vessels, the Rhode Island regiment with ours was obliged
to embark on board a number of flat-bottomed boats, which had been constructed
at Albany and brought to this place. We set out on this arduous and very hazardous
undertaking about Sept. 15 and arrived at Williamsburg the 26th. On our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</span>
passage, we hugged close the Western shore, but the many bays and mouths of
rivers we were obliged to cross rendered it exceedingly dangerous. I think the
rivers in their order were as follows, viz: Elk, Susquehannah, Petapsco, Severn,
Patuxent, Potomac, Rappahannock, Pequankitank, York and James. The bays
were numerous. Among the largest is Mock Jack,<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> better than 20 miles across.</p>

<p>The weather in general was very favorable excepting at the time of our
crossing the mouth of Rappahannock, when on a sudden, a furious wind arose,
which occasioned a very rough sea. A number of boats were dismasted, sails torn to
pieces, and the whole in the utmost distress. We, however, all made round the
point into a safe harbor, excepting Colonel Antill<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> who, missing the point, was
obliged to stretch for Given’s island. After repairing our rigging it was determined
to proceed a safer course than that which Colonel Antill took, by sailing
across Pequankitank bay into the mouth of a river which forms Given’s island.
In this attempt I shipped water several times and had all my sail torn to pieces.
Some of the boats were more prudent and did not cross that day. However, we all
arrived safe, and were detained there two days by the storm. Three vessels
sailing in the bay were the same day foundered. A miraculous escape! I cannot
but mention the very polite treatment we received from the inhabitants of Given’s
island.</p>

<p>I have said we arrived at Williamsburg the 26th; the 27th and 28th were
detained at this place in making preparations for the siege, and on the 29th the
allied army moved down toward York (distant from Williamsburg about 12
miles), and made a short halt about two miles distant from the enemy’s outworks
when a few shots were fired from the French pieces at some of Tarleton’s horse,
who immediately dispersed. In the course of the night three deserters came in
with little or no intelligence that could be depended on. On the morning of the
30th we had orders to approach the enemy’s works. After marching a short distance
we were ordered to load, and proceed within half a mile of the enemy’s works
on the left. One brigade of infantry was halted, while the First brigade, commanded
by Gen. Muhlenburg, crossed a small morass and paraded in order of
battle, marched a small distance in front; but the enemy not firing, they wheeled
to the right and took their post in the line; a picket was now turned out (the
better to favor reconnoitering parties) which advanced in front nearly half way
to the enemy, until they were obliged to retreat by the fire of a field piece from
the enemy’s works. (It was said his excellency, the commander-in-chief, was in
front of this picket the whole time reconnoitering.) The sentries were, however,
continued at their posts and regularly relieved the whole day. One of the sentries
was so unfortunate as to receive a wound on his foot from a cannon ball, which
obliged the surgeons to make an immediate amputation of his leg. We sustained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</span>
no other harm from their firing, although they frequently overshot us. The
remainder of the day was employed in reconnoitering the enemy; and toward
evening the whole army encamped nearly on the ground they had before occupied.
Before we proceed it may be proper now to take some notice of the different corps
and the arrangement of the army. The Marquis de Lafayette’s division of L.
infantry, composed of Muhlenburg’s and Hazen’s brigades on the right of the
front line, and nearest the enemy; the Baron Steuben’s division, composed of the
Marylanders, Pennsylvanians and Virginians on the left of the front line. The
Jersey troops in the rear of the infantry, &amp; the York in rear of Steuben’s division,
with the park of artillery and sappers and miners in the center, forming the second
line; the militia forms the corps de reserve, and the French troops, commanded by
Count Rochambeau, on the left of the whole. We passed this night with little
or no disturbance from the enemy, but guess our agreeable surprise when on the
morning of the ensuing day (Oct. 1) we found the enemy had evacuated all their
front works, and retreated about half a mile. We knew of no other way to
account for this than that their works being too extensive and weak, they were
afraid of a storm.</p>

<p>This morning Col. Scammel<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> was unfortunately wounded and taken by the
enemy, as he was too closely reconnoitering, and sent on parole to Williamsburg.
No sooner were the enemy’s works evacuated than they were taken possession of by
our pickets, supported by the whole army, who marched up for that purpose, and
continued on the lines a great part of the day, although the enemy at certain times
fired very briskly from their pieces. About 8 o’clock this morning the French
grenadiers attacked and carried a small battery, with the loss of four killed and
six wounded. Ten companies were ordered out early this morning for fatigue, of
which I had the honor to command one. Until 11 <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span> we were employed in
cutting and stripping branches for gabions. On being furnished with shovels,
spades, pickaxes, etc., we were ordered up to the lines, where we continued inactive
until about an hour before sunset. In the meantime, the engineers were employed
in reconnoitering the enemy’s works, and fixing on proper places to break the first
ground. Let me here observe that the enemy by evacuating their works had given
us an amazing advantage, as the ground they left commanded the whole town, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</span>
nothing but the reasons before alleged could have justified them in so doing, as by
contrary conduct they must have very much retarded the operations of the siege.</p>

<p>The engineers having fixed on and chained off the ground in two different
places to erect their works within point blank shot of the enemy, the parties were
called on. Five companies were ordered to an eminence on the right and five to
another on the left. It happened to be my fate to be stationed on the left, a place
the most dangerous of the two, as it was nearest to the enemy, and more exposed
to the fire from the enemy’s batteries [enemies batteries—copy]. We were now
conducted to a small hollow near the ground. Five men were ordered by the
engineer to assist him in clearing away the rubbish, staking out and drawing the
lines of the work. This was in the face of open day, and the men went with some
reluctance; a little before this we had a shot from the enemy which increased their
fears. At dusk of evening we all marched up, and never did I see men exert themselves
half so much or work with more eagerness. Indeed, it was their interest,
for they could expect nothing else but an incessant roar of cannon the whole night.
I must confess I too had my fears, but fortunately for us they did not fire a shot
that whole night. I am at a loss to account for it, for the moon shone bright, and
by the help of their night glasses they must certainly have discovered us. We were
relieved about daybreak, and scarcely had we left the trenches when the enemy
began their fire on both works from three pieces.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 2.</i>—The works were so far finished in the course of the preceding night
that the men worked in them this day with very little danger, although the enemy
kept up an almost incessant fire from two pieces of artillery. A drummer, rather
too curious in his observation, was this day killed with a cannon ball.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 3.</i>—Last night four men of our regiment, detached with the first brigade,
were unfortunately killed (on covering party) by one cannon ball; one of the men
belonged to my own company (Smith), a loss I shall ever regret as he was, without
exception, one of the finest men in the army. A militia man this day, possessed
of more bravery than prudence, stood constantly on the parapet and d—
his soul if he would dodge for the balls. He had escaped longer than could have
been expected, and, growing foolhardy, brandished his spade at every ball that
was fired till, unfortunately, a ball came that put an end to his capers. This
evening our brigade was ordered for an evening party, and in the course of the
night a deserter went to the enemy, informing them of our situation, in consequence
of which they directed a few shots our way, but did no harm.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 4.</i>—This morning, on leaving the ground, the enemy were complaisant
enough to favor us with a shot, but did no execution. Fatigues were continued
in the works as usual, and suffered little or no harm. This day’s orders give us
an account of Tarleton’s defeat on the Gloucester side on the 3d. He was attacked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</span>
by Duke Leziome’s<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> legion and the militia grenadiers, commanded by Mercer.
Tarleton lost 50 men, killed and wounded, the officer who commanded his infantry
killed, and himself badly wounded, with very little loss on our side.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 5.</i>—We had more firing from the enemy last night than any night since
the commencement of the siege, but don’t learn that they did any other harm than
delay the operation of the works. This day the regiment was employed in cutting
and making fasseines, and a regiment from every brigade in the army ordered out
for some extra fatigue duty this evening.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 6.</i>—The parties did not go out, and nothing extraordinary happened
this day.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 7.</i>—The regiments ordered for the extra duty were last night employed
in drawing the line of circumvallation. This line extends itself to the river on
each side the town, and at all places nearly equally distant and better than 200
yards in front of the former works. The enemy discovered us, although the night
was pretty favorable, but the chief of their fire was directed against the French.
They were, no doubt, much astonished in the morning to find themselves so completely
hemmed in on all sides, and trenches so deep that we could sustain little or
no harm from their fire. The trenches were this day to be enlivened with drums
beating and colors flying, and this honor was conferred on our division of light
infantry. And now I must confess, although I was fond of the honor, I had some
fear, as I had no notion of a covered way, and more especially as I was posted in
the center with the colors. We, however, did not lose a man in relieving, although
the enemy fired much. The covered way was of infinite service. Immediately upon
our arrival the colors were planted on the parapet with this motto: <i>Manus Haec
inimica tyrannis</i>. Our next maneuver was rather extraordinary. We were ordered
to mount the bank, front the enemy, and there by word of command go through
all the ceremony of soldiery, ordering and grounding our arms; and although the
enemy had been firing a little before, they did not now give us a single shot. I
suppose their astonishment at our conduct must have prevented them, for I can
assign no other reason. Col. Hamilton gave these orders, and although I esteem
him one of the first officers in the American army, must beg leave in this instance to
think he wantonly exposed the lives of his men. Our orders were this night that
if the enemy made a sortie and attempted to storm the trenches we were to give
them one fire from the barquet, rush over the parapet and meet them with the
bayonet.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 8.</i>—Some time before daylight this morning we were very much surprized
at the conduct of a picket that had been posted some little distance in front
of our works. They were fired upon by the enemy, never returned a single shot
and retreated into our works in the utmost disorder. Captain Weed, who commanded
the picket, was again ordered out, but the enemy had retired. How he
will be answerable for his conduct time will discover as I dare say he will soon be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</span>
obliged to give an account. One man of our picket was killed, though some think
it was by our men, as there had been other parties ordered out.</p>

<p>The fire of the enemy was this day chiefly directed against the parties employed
in erecting batteries. We were relieved about 12 o’clock and sustained no harm
during our tour excepting two men badly wounded; but we had scarcely left the
trenches when a man working on the parapet had his arm shot off. As soon as
we arrived in camp we changed our ground further to the right. Nothing extraordinary
happened the remainder of the day.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 9.</i>—Last night the troops in the trenches, as well as a great part of this
day, were busily employed in finishing the batteries, and about 4 o’clock this afternoon
an American battery was opened, consisting of three 24-pounders, three 12’s
and four 10-inch mortars. The enemy’s fire was chiefly directed against this battery,
and the others that were nearly finished.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 10.</i>—Last night the men were busily employed in finishing the batteries,
and early this morning four more were opened against the enemy, viz.: One
American battery on our left, consisting of four 18-pounders; the grand French
battery, consisting of 11 24-pounders, two 13-inch mortars, two howitzers, and
six 10-inch mortars; and another French battery of four 18-pounders and two
howitzers. The fourth is on the left of the French, but am not able as yet to
ascertain the number of guns. About 12 o’clock this day our division relieved the
trenches, and from that time the enemy fired but very little until the evening.
This afternoon our American bomb battery was opened of four 10-inch mortars.
A flag came out with Secretary Nelson. He informs us our fire did great execution
last night; that we had killed 11 or 12 of their officers, that his black servant was
killed by his bedside, and that the first gun fired killed two commissarys as they
were sitting at their wine.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 11.</i>—Last night commenced a very heavy cannonade, and the enemy
returned the fire with no less spirit. Being apprehensive of a storm, they often
fired in every direction. The largest of the enemy’s vessels was set on fire by the
bursting of a shell or a red hot ball from some of our batteries, and communicated
it to another, both of which were burnt down. They must have lost a considerable
quantity of powder in the last, as there was an explosion which made a heavy
report. The whole night was nothing but one continual roar of cannon, mixed
with the bursting of shells and rumbling of houses torn to pieces. As soon as the
day approached the enemy withdrew their pieces from their embrazures and retired
under cover of their works, and now commenced a still more dreadful cannonade
from all our batteries without scarcely any intermission for the whole day. We
were relieved about noon this day, and went home very much fatigued.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 12.</i>—Last night we began the second parallel and extended it better
than half round the enemy. This parallel is better than three hundred yards in
front of the other, and close upon the enemy’s right works. No sooner had the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</span>
morning made its appearance and the enemy discovered our very near approach,
than they commenced a very heavy fire from the batteries and in the course of the
day no little surprised us by opening five royals, as we were in hopes they had no
shells, by their not giving them on the first parallel.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 13.</i>—Last night we were employed in strengthening the line, and began
a French battery and a redoubt. We lost several men this night, as the enemy by
practice were enabled to throw their shells with great certainty. About noon this
day our division relieved the trenches, and about 2 o’clock advanced to the second
parallel. Capt. White and one private of Col. Wee’s regiment were this day killed
by a horizontal shell. The militia suffered much this afternoon.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 14.</i>—The enemy last night kept up a continual blaze from several pieces
of cannon of nine royals and some howitzers. Early in the night the fire was
chiefly directed against the French, who were just on our left, but about 10 o’clock
our people [began] to erect a battery. They soon discovered us, and changed the
direction of their fire. It happened to be our lot to lie in the trenches just in the
rear of the battery exposed to all their fire; and now were I to recount all the
narrow escapes I made that night it would almost be incredible. I cannot, however,
but take notice of a remarkable and miraculous one indeed. About midnight
the sentry called “A shell!” I jumped up immediately to watch the direction,
but had no suspicion of its coming so near until it fell in the center of the trench,
within less than two feet of me. I immediately flung myself on the banques among
some arms, and although the explosion was very sudden and the trench as full of
men as it could possibly contain, yet not a single man was killed and only two
of my own company slightly wounded. I should not forget here that Capt.
Hughes and Dr. Anderson, two intimate friends and very worthy officers, were
sitting close by me at this time. We all counted it a most miraculous escape.
Fatigue parties were still continued at work in the open face of day at the battery,
although they suffered much. Ten men of Col. Barber’s regiment were killed and
wounded in a very few minutes, five of whom belonged to Capt. Pry’s camp. Our
division was relieved about 12 o’clock, and on our march home two of our men
were wounded by the bursting of a shell. About 5 o’clock this day we were again
ordered for the trenches.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 15.</i>—I have just said we were ordered yesterday to the trenches. The
French grenadiers were ordered out the same time, and all for the purpose of
storming two redoubts on the enemy’s left. Our division arrived at the deposite
of the [copy defective.—J.] a little before dark where every man was ordered to
disencumber himself of his pack. The evening was pretty dark and favored the
attack. The column advanced, Col. Guinot’s<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> regiment in front and ours in the
rear. We had not got far before we were discovered, and now the enemy opened a
fire of cannon, grape shot, shell and musketry upon us, but all to no effect. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</span>
column moved on undisturbed and took the redoubt by the bayonet without firing
a single gun. The enemy made an obstinate defense (but what cannot brave men
do when determined?). We had 7 men killed and 30 wounded. Among the
latter were Col. Guinot, Maj. Barber and Capt. Olney. Fifteen men of the
enemy were killed and wounded in the work, 20 were taken prisoners besides Maj.
Campbell, who commanded, a captain and one ensign. The chief of the garrison
made their escape during the storm by a covered way.</p>
</div>

<p>Captain Duncan’s diary, it will be observed, closes with the record
of October 15. The failure to complete it for the remaining days of
the siege is to be accounted for by the fact that he and his command were
so actively employed in military operations that neither time nor opportunity
to write was afforded him.</p>

<p>Fortunately, we are enabled to complete the record by referring to
the “Military Journal of the Revolution,” written by Dr. James Thacher
(born in Barnstable, Mass., Feb. 14, 1754, died in Plymouth, Mass.,
May 24, 1844), who as Surgeon’s Mate and Surgeon served in the Revolutionary
War. As Surgeon of a Massachusetts regiment he was present
at the siege of Yorktown. His diary very appropriately supplements
Captain Duncan’s record. What follows is a condensation:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Oct. 16.</i>—Early in the morning, Col. Abercrombie with about four hundred
men, made an attack on two unfinished French redoubts, and succeeded in spiking
seven or eight pieces of cannon. The French advanced and recaptured the redoubts.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 17.</i>—From the American line of works at least a hundred pieces of
heavy ordnance were playing upon the British lines, and doing great destruction.
The whole peninsula trembled under the incessant thunderings of the immense
field pieces. Great destruction was the result. The great havoc upon Cornwallis’s
position was apparent to his besiegers, compelling him to ask for suspension of
hostilities with a view to capitulation.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 18.</i>—It was ascertained that Cornwallis attempted, on the night of the
16th, to escape by crossing to Gloucester Point with a portion of his command. A
heavy storm prevented his execution of the plot, and with difficulty his men returned
to their positions. On this day Washington communicated the terms of capitulation,
and allowed two hours for their acceptance.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 19.</i>—The surrender actually occurs. Gen. O’Hara, as the representative
of Cornwallis, who seems to have recoiled from the humiliation of surrender,
apologized to Washington for the non-appearance of his chief, and conducted the
further operations of the capitulation. General Lincoln on the American side
accepted the tokens of surrender.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</span></p>

<p><i>Oct. 20.</i>—In general orders Washington thanks officers and men, both French
and American, for their services in the campaign.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 21.</i>—This being Sunday, some of the troops participated in divine service.
Mr. Evans preaching an appropriate discourse, which was listened to by Generals
Lincoln and Clinton.</p>
</div>

<p>Yorktown was the site of the closing battle of the American
Revolution.</p>

<p>The surrender included 7,247 regular troops, 840 sailors, and 225
guns.</p>

<p>The British loss in killed, wounded, and missing was 550; that of the
Americans and French some 300.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="A_PORT_OF_THE_LAST_CENTURY">A PORT OF THE LAST CENTURY</h2>
</div>


<p>When white frosts and keen, starry nights have turned the
foliage of the Niagara gorge into a riotous color scheme is the
best time to visit Queenston Heights, and walk the grass-grown
thoroughfares of the forgotten hamlet at their base.</p>

<p>It is the best time, because the picnic and tourist season is over, and
one’s contemplation of the beautiful view which every point affords is not
disturbed; and as for the cluster of roof-trees lying below, it is more
picturesque in its autumnal nakedness.</p>

<p>Three-score years ago this village was the second town of importance
in the province of Upper Canada. Named for Queen Charlotte, Queenston
began life auspiciously in 1787 with a dock, a distillery, and a tavern;
and so rapidly did it grow that the opening century found the dock transformed
into a wharf flanked with store-houses, the population doubled,
and those infallible signs of prosperity in a new country—a grist- and a
saw-mill—running on full time.</p>

<p>Situated at the head of the St. Lawrence route, and at the foot of
the Chippewa portage, Queenston had every advantage at the start. It
was the natural <i>dépôt</i> and point of departure for the western trade, now
growing rapidly with the opening of new territory. Across its narrow
wharf, and up the Chippewa road, flowed for over a quarter of a century,
a continuous tide of traffic, which eddying here, débouched on the near
shore of the upper lakes, or spent itself in the wilderness of the far west.</p>

<p>Hither swarmed the motley crowd that follows the hunter’s trail and
the pioneer’s axe—fur-traders, settlers, speculators, Indians, emigrants,
and adventurers.</p>

<p>Government land in Canada was very cheap as compared with the
price of land in the “States,” and this fact alone accounts for the great
influx into Canada of Americans, immediately after the close of the War.</p>

<p>This land boom, so wisely fostered, was too soon paralyzed by the
War of 1812, and nowhere did the hardships of that war fall more
heavily than upon the new port of the lower Niagara. When the hastily-planned
and ill-executed assault upon Queenston Heights was made, it
was only defended by a small battery upon which a solitary field-piece was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</span>
mounted. Those extensive earthworks west of the monument were an
afterthought. They were not built until 1814.</p>

<p>General Brock was killed below this redan; and the heaviest fighting
must have been along the foot of the ledge. A small cenotaph marks the
spot where Brock fell. This little monument is more interesting from the
fact that King Edward himself, as Prince of Wales, placed the block in
position in 1860.</p>

<p>But for situation, no monument in the country can compare with
that which marks the place of General Brock’s sepulchre. Standing on
the very crown of the Heights, this shaft dominates a wonderful picture.
The monument itself is of the usual British type, and the figure surmounting
it might be Nelson, so very like is it to that hero’s attitude in stone.</p>

<p>The house into which General Brock was carried dying stands, a
grey-stone ruin by the untraveled way. Other wounded soldiers besides
Brock were carried into that low-roofed house to die. Diagonally across
from this place is the house in which Laura Secord was living when she
saved the British stores at De Cew’s.</p>

<p>It is not generally known that this famous Canadian heroine was
born and lived in Massachusetts, until her twentieth year. In 1795 her
father, Thomas Ingersoll, a Revolutionary soldier, came to Canada to
buy land; and shortly after the family arrived at Niagara, Laura married
James Secord of Queenston.</p>

<p>During the second year of the War of 1812, the Niagara frontier
of Canada was in possession of the American forces, and American soldiers
were billeted upon every family on the border.</p>

<p>Hearing some officers, whom she was thus forced to entertain, discussing
a plan for seizing the stores at the De Cew house, some eighteen
miles away, she determined to inform the officer in command at that place.
It meant a long, dangerous journey on foot, over hill and bog land and
through a densely wooded country swarming with hideous savages from
the Grand River, the allies of the British. But Laura Secord was equal
to the occasion. Though she had started from home before daylight,
night overtook her on the journey. Her courage and promptness saved
the stores, and the officer in command sent her home under the protection
of a guard.</p>

<p>When the Prince of Wales visited Canada he sent her one hundred
dollars, the first recognition made of her services to her adopted country.</p>

<p>As we stroll farther along the King’s highway we come to the Wadsworth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</span>
cottage, a rough-cast dwelling with sills much below the level of the
street. This was a tavern at the time of the battle, and in the front room
to the left, General Scott was detained as a prisoner. It was here, while
waiting for his captors to complete arrangements for his removal to Fort
George, that an Indian in the barroom deliberately took aim at the
General through the open door, and would have shot him but for the
presence of mind of Captain Thaddeus Davis, a British officer, who
promptly knocked the gun from the Indian’s hands.</p>

<p>Screened by a clump of maples and rank shrubbery that speaks of
an old-time garden, is a ruined stone house, rather more pretentious than
those that date back to the period of the War. It is spoken of by the
townspeople as the “blue-stone house.” In this house in 1824 William
Lyon Mackenzie printed the first numbers of the <i>Colonial Advocate</i>, the
first paper printed in Upper Canada.</p>

<p>“We are not in want, neither are we rich,” he says candidly in his
prospectus. O, golden age! Our strenuous present admits of no such
happy medium! Mackenzie is remembered no more as an agitator. The
measures of justice for which he contended in the bitterness of poverty
and exile, have long since been granted and enjoyed.</p>

<p>If plenty of relics of historic Queenston abound, no trace of its one-time
prosperity remains. Gone the shipping and trade along with the
store-houses bursting with pelts, and rum, and merchandise. Gone that
horse railway to Chippewa, built to relieve congested traffic. Gone the
bank, with its funds, and the unlucky thirteen taverns that tradition says
lined the principal street. Gone, too, that first bridge that spanned the
river, built in 1851, just too late to divert from newer channels the ebbing
current of commerce.</p>

<p>The great cataract being more accessible by the Queenston route, all
the distinguished visitors to our shores in former years came to this port.
Chateaubriand was here as early as 1790. Lafayette, Thomas Moore,
the Bourbon princes, and Louis Napoleon saw the town enjoying the top-most
wave of prosperity. It is said that Moore’s poem beginning, “I
knew by the smoke that so gracefully curled,” was inspired by the breakfast
fire of one of Queenston’s houselets.</p>

<p>But if these later annals are more brilliant, they seem to belong less
to the Queenston of to-day than that earlier history which gives the
delightful old place a notable part in the making of a Great Dominion.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="INDIANA_COUNTY_NAMES">INDIANA COUNTY NAMES</h2>
</div>


<p>The influence of the strong men of any time upon their time and
community is strikingly illustrated by a study of the origin
of the names of the counties of Indiana, which has just been completed
by an old resident of the State after the work of collecting the
scattered material in odd moments during the last twenty years. The
result as completed shows that seventy-eight of the ninety-two counties
were named after men prominent nationally or locally, in war and in
peace; men of foreign birth and foreign training, of foreign birth and
native training, and native birth and native training. And the strong
influence of men whose personality so dominated small communities, men
whose names have not been handed down as taking part in the affairs of
the nation, is shown by the fact that of the seventy-eight men whose names
have been given to counties of the State, forty-one were men whose life
and work, influential as it must have been in the particular communities
wherein they lived, were not of sufficient prominence to save them from
almost utter oblivion in State or National history.</p>

<p>Of the thirty-eight counties that have been named from what might
be called well-known men, men of more than local prominence, seven were
named for Presidents of the United States: Madison, Monroe, Washington,
Jefferson, Jackson, Harrison (William Henry Harrison), and
Adams (John Quincy Adams); sixteen were named for men prominent
in military history—Clark, for George Rogers Clark; Decatur, for the
commodore; De Kalb, for the famous German of Revolutionary days;
Fayette, for La Fayette; Marion, for General Francis Marion; Morgan,
for General Daniel Morgan; Perry and Porter, for Commodores Perry
and Porter; Pulaski, for the Polish soldier; Putnam, for General Israel
Putnam; Steuben, for Baron Steuben; Wayne, for “Mad Anthony”;
Kosciusko, for the Polish soldier; Knox, for General Knox, one of the
first secretaries of war; Greene, for General Nathaniel Greene; Warren,
for General Joseph Warren, who fell at Bunker Hill, and Stark, for
Captain John Stark, victor at the battle of Bennington.</p>

<p>Six signers of the Declaration of Independence were honored in the
naming of counties—Huntington, Carroll, Franklin, Hamilton, Hancock,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</span>
and Jay. De Witt Clinton is honored in the naming of Clinton County.
The eight other counties named for men of more than local prominence
are Benton, after Thomas H. Benton; Boone, after the frontiersman;
Clay, after Henry Clay; Fulton, after the inventor of the steamboat;
Marshall, after the great Chief Justice; Henry, after Patrick Henry;
Jennings, after Jonathan Jennings, Indiana’s first governor, and Posey,
another governor, appointed to succeed Harrison.</p>

<p>Howard County is the only Indiana county that has changed its
name. Its first name was Francisville, the name of a famous Indian chief,
but on account of the universal esteem in which Colonel T. A. Howard, a
prominent citizen of the community, was held, the name was changed.</p>

<p>Grant County was named for two Grant brothers, Samuel and
Moses, early settlers in this region. Parke, for Benjamin Parke, one of
the earliest of the educators in the State. He founded the State Law
Library, was the first president of the Indiana Historical Society, and
coöperated in the founding of the Vincennes Library and University.</p>

<p>Vigo County was named for Colonel Francis Vigo, a Sardinian,
whose services were invaluable to General Clark in the capture of Vincennes.
The bell now hanging in the court house at Terre Haute was
bought with the $500 set apart in his will to show his appreciation of the
people giving his name to the county.</p>

<p>Four counties—Delaware, Miami, Tippecanoe, and Wabash—received
Indian names. St. Joseph County was named after the river
running through it, named by the early French settlers. Switzerland was
so named because most of the early settlers were Swiss, coming to grow
grapes on the plan followed in the old country. The scheme failed.
Ohio County was named for the river; Lake, for Lake Michigan; Elkhart,
for a small island in the river that flows through the county.
Laporte was named by the French. Three counties—Orange, Vermilion,
and Randolph—were named after counties in other States—Vermilion
for an Illinois county directly over the line, Orange and Randolph for
North Carolina counties.</p>

<p>Of the remaining counties three were named after men of only local
prominence: Allen, for Colonel John Allen, a Kentuckian who fell at
the battle of River Raisin; Bartholomew, for General Joseph Bartholomew,
State Senator, and identified with the early Indian wars; Blackford,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</span>
for a judge of that name; Brown, for General Jacob Brown, one of the
heroes of the War of 1812; Cass, for General Lewis Cass.</p>

<p>Crawford County was named for Colonel William Crawford,
Washington’s land agent in the West, who was finally taken prisoner by
the Indians and burned at the stake; Daviess, for Joseph H. Daviess,
distinguished lawyer; Dearborn, for General Henry Dearborn, once
secretary of war.</p>

<p>Toussaint Dubois, a Frenchman who had charge of the spies under
General William Henry Harrison, has the name of Dubois County as a
memorial. Floyd County was named after Colonel John Floyd, an old
Indian fighter; Fountain, for Major Fountaine of Boone County, Kentucky,
who was killed in the battle of Maumee, October 22, 1790.</p>

<p>General John Gibson, after whom the county of that name was
called, was secretary of war, who repeatedly acted as territorial governor
of the State in the absence of General Harrison. He was taken captive
by the Indians, made himself one of them for a long time, finally going
blind. Hendricks County was named after William Hendricks, the
State’s first representative in Congress, and governor from 1822 to 1824.</p>

<p>Jasper County was named after Sergeant Jasper, the Revolutionary
hero; Johnson, for John Johnson, one of the early judges of the Supreme
Court; Lawrence, for Captain James Lawrence, an esteemed citizen of
the community; Martin, after Major Martin, a citizen of Newport, Ky.;
Montgomery, for General Richard Montgomery.</p>

<p>There is some question as to the origin of the name of Newton
County. Some investigators contend that it was named after a sergeant
in the Revolutionary war, while others give the more poetic explanation
that at the time of the organization of the county one of the commissioners,
who was somewhat of an astronomer, was an ardent admirer of Sir
Isaac Newton, and saw that the county was named after him.</p>

<p>Noble County was named after Governor Noble; Owen, after
Colonel Owen of Kentucky, who was killed in the battle of Tippecanoe;
Pike, after Zebulon M. Pike, killed at the capture of York; Ripley, for
General E. W. Ripley, an officer of 1812; Rush, for Dr. Benjamin Rush,
a prominent citizen; Scott, for General Charles Scott, the Revolutionary
soldier and later governor of Kentucky; Spencer, for Captain
Spier Spencer, who fell at the battle of Tippecanoe; Sullivan, for Daniel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</span>
Sullivan, who was killed by the Indians on the road from Vincennes to
Louisville while carrying public papers; Tipton, for General John
Tipton, who served in Congress; Vanderburg, for Henry Vanderburg,
captain in the Revolution, member of the Legislative Council of the
Northwest, and presiding judge of the first court organized in the Territory;
Warrick, for Colonel Jacob Warrick, who fell at Tippecanoe;
Wells, for Captain W. H. Wells, killed by the Indians while carrying
papers from Fort Wayne to Fort Dearborn, now Chicago; White, for
Captain Isaac White, killed at Tippecanoe; and Whitley, for Colonel
William Whitley, who was killed in the battle of the Thames.—<i>Indianapolis

<h3><i>IV.</i><br>
THE DANCING GHOSTS</h3>

<p>That beautiful phenomenon known to the white man as the Aurora
Borealis, or Northern Lights, is called by the Chippewa Indians
<i>Je-bi-ne-me-id-de-wand</i>, or the Dancing Ghosts. The legends accounting
for it are numerous, and the following, which was related to the
translator by a Chippewa hunter, named <i>Kehes-Chock</i>, or Precipice
Leaper, is quite as fantastic as the phenomenon itself. That it is a very
ancient tradition is evident from the fact that the sacrifice to which it
alludes has not been practiced by the Chippewas for at least a century
(1850).</p>

<p>There was a time when all the inhabitants of the far North were
afflicted by a famine. It was in the depth of winter, and the weather
had for a long time been so cold that even the white bear was afraid to
leave his hiding place. The prairies were so deeply covered with snow
that the deer and the buffalo were compelled to wander to a warmer
climate, and the lakes and rivers were so closely packed with ice that it
was only once in a while that even a fish could be obtained. Such sorrow
as reigned throughout the land had never before been known. The
magicians and wise men kept themselves hidden in their cabins. The
warriors and hunters, instead of boasting of their exploits, crowded
around their camp-fires, and in silence meditated upon their unhappy
doom. Mothers abandoned their children to seek for berries in the
desolate forests, and the fingers of the young women had become stiff
from idleness, for they had not any skins out of which to make the comfortable
moccasin. From one end of the Chippewa country to the other
was heard the cry of hunger and distress. That the Great Spirit was
angry with his people was universally believed, but for what reason none
of the magicians could tell. The chief of the Chippewas was the oldest
man in the nation, and he was consulted in regard to the impending
calamity. He could give no reason for the famine, but stated that he
had been informed in a dream that the anger of the Great Spirit could be
appeased by a human sacrifice. How this should come to pass, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</span>
he could not tell, and therefore concluded to summon to his lodge all the
medicine-men who lived within a day’s journey, for the purpose of consulting
with them. He did so, and when the council was ended it was proclaimed
that three Chippewas should be immediately bound to the stake
and consumed. They were to be selected by lot from among the warriors
of the tribe; and, when this sad intelligence was promulgated, a national
assembly was ordered to convene.</p>

<p>The appointed time arrived, and, in the presence of a large multitude,
the fatal lots were cast, and three of the bravest men of the tribe
were thus appointed to the sacrifice. They submitted to their fate without
a murmur. Whilst their friends gathered around them with wild
lamentations, and decked them with the costliest robes and ornaments to
be found in all the tribe, the youthful warriors uttered not a word about
their untimely departure, but only spoke in the most poetical language of
the happy hunting grounds upon which they were about to enter. The
spot selected for the sacrifice was the summit of a neighboring hill which
was covered with woods. Upon this spot had three stakes been closely
erected, around which there had been collected a large pile of dry branches
and other combustible materials. To the stakes, at the hour of midnight,
and by the hands of the magicians, unattended by spectators, were the
three warriors securely fastened. They performed their cruel duty in
silence, and the only sounds that broke the stillness of that winter night
were the songs and the shoutings of the multitude assembled in the
neighboring village. The incantations of the priests being ended, they
applied a torch to the faggots, and, returning to their village, spent the
remainder of the night in performing a variety of strange and heart-sickening
ceremonies.</p>

<p>Morning dawned, and upon the hill of sacrifice was to be seen only
a pile of smouldering ashes. On that day the weather moderated, and
an unusual number of hunters went forth in pursuit of game. They were
all more successful than they had been for many seasons, and there was an
abundance of sweet game, such as the buffalo, the bear, and the deer in
every wigwam. A council was called, and the patriarch chief proclaimed
the glad tidings that the Great Spirit had accepted their sacrifice, and
that it was now the duty of his children to express their gratitude by a
feast—the fast of <i>bitter roots</i>.</p>

<p>The appointed night arrived, and the bitterest roots which could be
found in the lodges of the magicians were collected together and made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</span>
into soup. The company assembled to partake of this feast, was the
largest that had ever been known, and, as they were to conclude their ceremony
of thankfulness by dancing, they had cleared the snow from the
center of their village, and on this spot were they duly congregated. It
was a cold and remarkably clear night, and their watchfires burnt with
uncommon brilliancy. It was now the hour of midnight, and the bitter
soup was all gone. The flutes and the drums had just been brought out,
and the dancers, decked in their most uncouth dresses, were about to enter
the charmed ring, when a series of loud shoutings were heard, and the
eyes of the entire multitude were intently fixed upon the northern sky,
which was illuminated by a most brilliant and unearthly light. It was a
light of many colors, and as changeable as the reflections upon a summer
sea at the sunset hour. Across this light were constantly dancing three
huge figures of a crimson hue, and these did the magicians proclaim to be
the ghosts of the three warriors who had given up their bodies for the
benefit of their people, and who had thus become great chiefs in the spirit-land.
The fire by which their bodies had been consumed had also consumed
every feeling of revenge; and ever since that remote period it has
been their greatest pleasure to illume by their appearance on winter nights
the pathway of the hunters over the snowy plains of the north.</p>

<h3>LETTER OF WASHINGTON TO DR. STUART</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(An important autograph letter of Washington, addressed to Dr. David Stuart, of Fairfax,
Va., who was the husband of Mrs. Washington’s niece. He gives his views on Government
salaries, and mentions Jefferson, and others).</p>
</div>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Philadelphia</span>, <i>March</i> 3rd., 1793.<br>
<br>
Dear Sir;<br>
</p>

<p>The official letter from the Commissioners to me—dated the 8th of
last month—promising their sentiments on the subject of compensation,
so soon as a meeting was had with Mr Johnson, prevented my acknowledging
the receipt of your private letter of the same date and on the same
subject, until now; nor shall I do more than slightly touch on it until I receive
the further sentiments of the board thereupon. It may not be amiss,
however, in this friendly &amp; confidential manner, previously to regret that
the expectations of the Commissioners and the opinions of those who were
consulted on the compensation proper to be made them for past and
future services, should accord so little. It is to observed (as was mentioned
in my last) that the law authorizing the appointment contemplates
no pay. Justice however, requires it—and therefore such as it was conceived
would meet the concurrence of the public was allotted. In similar
cases it rarely happens that high, if any salleries are allowed. Instance
the Directors of the Potomac Company—of the Canal Navigation of this
State—the Banks, &amp;c &amp;c—I do not quote these cases, however, to prove
that Salleries ought not to be allowed in the case of the Commissioners of
the federal district for the past, and compensation for their future services;
but only to shew the necessity of their being as low as could comport
with Justice—With respect to your ideas of a future allowance I am bold
in assuring you as my opinion that, no fixed Sallery in the United States
(however they have been reprobated for their extravagance), from the
Chief Magistrate to the door-keeper of the House of Representatives, is
equal to one thousand Dollars clear of expences. The reasons are too
obvious to stand in need of enumeration—and I must candidly declare that
I see little use for a Superintendant if more will be required of the Commissioners
than either to form or to adopt plans;—give the great outlines
thereof in Instruction;—and leave the details and execution to the Superintendant,
who ought, as I have declared in a letter to you dated the 30th
of November last, to be always on the Spot—(unless the duties of the
trust should take him away, to facilitate the objects of it)—Under this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</span>
idea, could it suit any person better than yourself to visit the federal City
once every three or four months—suppose every two months—when you
have an Estate opposite to it that has a claim to a share of your attention,—as
to the suspicion which may arise—if you serve for daily pay—that
your sessions will be prolonged by it, they are not worth regarding—The
malevolence of man is not to be avoided.—But instead of <i>touching</i> the
subject only, in the manner I proposed, I find I am enlarging upon it, and
therefore will change it.</p>

<p>Mr Jefferson is at a loss to discover what could have proceeded from
him to Mr Ellicott that should have occasioned any discontent in the
mind of the latter with the Commissioners;—and having shewn me the
<i>only</i> letter which (he says) he has written to him for many months I see
nothing there on which to found the conjecture contained in the latter
part of your letter of the 8th of February.</p>

<p>As I do not take the George Town paper, and have seen no extracts
from it in any others, I do not know to what it is you allude—in your letter
of the 8 &amp; 18 inst which came to hand a few days ago.—Mr Ellicot has
never come near me since his return to the City:—no explanation therefore
on this—the case of Mr Young, or any other subject has taken place between
us. With respect to Mr Young’s renewed application for a change
towards the point, &amp;c. I scarcely know what answer to make at this time.—A
change in one instance will, I am certain, open a wide door which could
not easily be shut. Therefore before I could consent even to take the
matter into consideration it would be necessary to have an accurate plan of
the parts, delineated upon paper, with the alterations he proposes; and to
have the Commissioners’ opinion of the consequences result’g from the
adoption of it, in writing; for unless there are some powerful reasons for
discrimination, it would be bad policy to comply with the request of one
of the Proprietors, and reject the application of another. It is possible,
&amp; not improbable that I may be at George Town on my way to Mount
Vernon, about the first of April; when, if every thing was prepared for it,
I might on the spot be better able to give an opinion. But, as Mr Young
is in the occupancy of the whole, I see no cause for hasty decision which
may create (if an alteration should take place) discontents in other quarters.—No
letter to me, has been received from him yet.</p>

<h3>LETTER OF JOSEPH TRUMBULL (SON OF “BROTHER JONATHAN”) TO

<span class="smcap">Ty</span> (<span class="smcap">Ticonderoga</span>) 3rd <i>November</i>, 1776<br>
<br>
Dear Sir,<br>
</p>

<p>I Received your polite favour of the middle of last month, amid such
a hurry of business &amp; Expectation that I omitted answering it—this Day
I am Honor’d with your’s of the 29th by Major Stewart. Nothing mentional
has happen’d till this Day we are informed that the Enemy have
abandoned Crown Point, Chimney Point, &amp;c., entirely, Determined on
Winter Quarters in Canada. Its a prudent Choice I fancy, as we should
not have parted with ours to them at a low Price &amp; a high one they could
not afford. I wish to have it confirm’d—Delay to us is Victory—&amp;
Victory procured without loss of Blood is more Glorious than any other.
You must excuse my being so concise, my Best Compliments attend the
Ladies &amp; Poor Wilkinson, Jr.</p>

<h3>PART OF A LETTER OF WASHINGTON TO BENJAMIN HARRISON, SIGNER OF
THE DECLARATION AND MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF WAR</h3>

<p>
<i>Dated at</i> <span class="smcap">Middlebrook, N. J.</span>, <i>May 5, 1779</i>.<br>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(As the letter covers ten folio pages, we give only the salient points of it. It was sold in
the Bishop Hurst collection, last Spring, for $1065, the largest price ever paid for a Washington
letter).</p>
</div>

<p>The letter commences by referring to some statements in a previous
letter recommending certain measures, and reiterates their necessity, and
that if longer delayed “<i>I shall not scruple to add that our affairs are irretrievably
lost</i>.” He also predicts that the result will be “<i>the fate of our
paper money and with it a general crash of all things</i>.” Washington then
proceeds:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The measures of Ministry are taken, and the whole
strength and resources of the Kingdom will be exerted against
it in this campaign; while we have been slumbering and sleeping,
or disputing upon trifles, contenting ourselves with laughing
at the impotence of Great Britain.... Accts. from
London to the 9th. of March, have fixed me in the opinion that
G. Britain will strain every nerve to distress us this campaign,
but where or in what manner her principal forces will be employed
I cannot determine.... My own opinion of the
matter is that, they will keep a respectable force at (New
York), and push their operations vigorously to the Southward,
where we are most vulnerable, and least able to afford succour....
She may, cercumstanced as we are, give a very unfavourable
turn to that pleasing slumber, we have been in for
the last eight months.... From present appearances I
have not the smallest doubt but that we shall be hard pushed in
every quarter. This campaign will be the grand, and if unsuccessful,
more than probable the last struggle of Great Britain....
They are raising all the Indians from North to South
which their arts and money can procure, and a powerful diversion
they will make in this quarter with the aid they expect from
Canada.”</p>
</div>

<p>Washington then criticises the method of calling out the Militia,
condemning it, and proposes another scheme. He also writes about the
treatment of the British prisoners, and then returns again to the operations
and conduct of the war.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I view General Philips in the light of a dangerous man—in
his march to Charlotteville he was guilty of a very grave
breach of military judgment and of a procedure highly criminal;
for instead of pursuing the route pointed out to him he went”—(Washington
then describes the route).</p>
</div>

<p>The General then gives warning that deserters or prisoners must not
be trusted, giving some interesting facts, and proceeds to relate the latest
news of the operations against the Indians on the frontier. The letter is
signed G. Washington in full, and a postscript is added giving some news
of the sailing of a British expedition, presumably to Georgia, and stating
what he has ordered in consequence, signed G. W.</p>

<h3 id="NEW_JERSEY">NEW JERSEY HISTORICAL SOCIETY</h3>

<p>The annual meeting of The New
Jersey Historical Society was held in
the beautiful and spacious building of the
Society on West Park Street, Newark,
on October 25, 1905. A business meeting
was held at noon, at which the
annual reports of officers were read,
showing the very prosperous condition
of the Society. The Corresponding
Secretary, William Nelson, in his report
alluded to the fact that the present completed
his twenty-fifth year of continuous
service as an officer of the Society, and
so was a sort of silver jubilee of his.
He was elected Recording Secretary in
1880, holding that office for ten years,
when he was elected Corresponding
Secretary, which office he has held for
fifteen years. The correspondence during
the year had embraced between 400
and 500 letters of all sorts and covering
a great variety of topics.</p>

<p>Francis M. Tichenor, Librarian, reported
that during the year there had
been 2400 visitors at the Library.</p>

<p>Ernest E. Coe, for the Committee on
Membership, reported that the Society
now had 784 members.</p>

<p>A very important adjunct of the
Society for several years past has been
the Woman’s Branch, presided over by
Miss M. Antoinette Quinby, who read
the report of the work of that body.
The women have been devoting themselves
specially during the past year to
the compilation of tombstone inscriptions
throughout the State, and Miss
Quinby presented to the Society two
large, handsome volumes of such inscriptions.</p>

<p>Dr. J. Ackerman Coles, Judge Amzi
Dodd, Robert F. Ballantine, Wallace
M. Scudder and George R. Howe were
elected Trustees for the term of three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</span>
years, and Jonathan W. Roberts for the
term of one year to fill a vacancy.</p>

<p>The address of the day was delivered
by the Rev. William Y. Chapman,
pastor of the Roseville (Newark)
Presbyterian Church, his subject being
“Acadia.” He was himself a native of
Nova Scotia, and from his earliest boyhood
had been familiar with the scenes
so beautifully and pathetically described
by Longfellow in his exquisite poem
“Evangeline.” In the interest of truth,
however, he was constrained to say that
the cold facts of history differed very
widely from the narrative of the romantic
poem, and he described clearly and
graphically the events which constrained
the English commander to deport the
recalcitrant French settlers.</p>

<p>At a subsequent meeting of the Board
of Trustees of the Society, the following
officers were elected for the ensuing
year:</p>

<p>President, Jonathan W. Roberts;
Vice-Presidents, Wallace M. Scudder,
Francis M. Tichenor and George R.
Howe; Corresponding Secretary, William
Nelson; Recording Secretary,
Joseph F. Folsom; Treasurer, William
C. Morton; Librarian, Francis M.
Tichenor; Trustees to fill vacancies,
Dr. W. S. Disbrow, of Newark, and
W. Elwood Speakman, of Woodbury.</p>


<h3 id="BOOK_NOTICES">BOOK NOTICES</h3>

<p>The Records of the Town of Hanover,
New Hampshire, 1761-1818. The
records of the town meetings, and of
the selectmen, comprising all of the first
volume of records and being Volume I
of the printed records of the town.
Printed by vote of the town under the
direction of Herbert Darling Foster,
George Mendal Bridgman, Sidney Bradshaw
Fay. Hanover, New Hampshire,
1905. Octavo, pp. VI+336.</p>

<p>The committee of learned men appointed
by the selectmen of Hanover
to print the early records of that town
apparently have endeavored to reproduce
faithfully the original spelling,
capitalization and punctuation. Both
copy and proofs have been compared with
the records word for word, and when
necessary letter by letter. The moderate
sum of money used in preserving and
making easily accessible to students these
early annals has been well spent. The
committee having this volume in charge
suggests that the proprietors’ records
(covering the years 1761 to 1807 inclusive)
and the first volume of vital statistics
(covering the years 1762 to 1846)
ought also to be printed. All persons
interested in the history of Hanover
ought to use their influence towards
carrying out this wise suggestion at once
and having it done under the direction
of the same committee.</p>

<p>The contents of the book and the
space of time covered are accurately indicated
by the title, but one very important
feature of the work, not there
mentioned, is the town clerk’s affidavit
that the printed book is a true and correct
copy of the original. The original
paging is marked in brackets. The book
is well indexed and substantially bound.</p>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this

prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,

unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, &#8220;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.&#8221;

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
